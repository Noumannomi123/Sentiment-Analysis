A second album has crashed the servers,-
You are so unhinged for this but LMAO,-
me n who rn,-
I full on slapped my husbands face in bed. I was aiming for his shoulder but things are unhinged.,-
"I’ve been choking myself trying not to laugh at some of the memes while my partner sleeps. I’m unemployed right now, so my job is to let him sleep while I scroll 😂",-
Me and my Swiftie friends screaming in excitement via text at the same time,-
i remember when this happened; it’s so crazy that it’s a meme now,-
I'm losing my fucking mind over here. Thank god I don't live on the East Coast! Ahhhhh!!!,-
As a corporate east coast swiftie…. Rip me lol,-
"I don’t know how I’m gonna do tomorrow morning, sis. 😩",-
If anyone even looks at me at work…..,-
"Thank god I work from home, that’s all I have to say lmao",-
NON EAST COASTERS REPRESENT (crying in central time),-
"east coast swiftie here, took off 2 days of work for this because i knew blondie was gonna ruin my sleep schedule and my life after midnights. 🫡",-
its for the 4am taylor vibes insomnia girlies,-
I’m dying over here 😂,-
"it’s like she saw the 1989tv surprise double album theories and thought “oh shit that’s a good idea actually, let me do that”",-
"I mean, she kinda did it already with Midnights and the 3am version",-
isn't the 3am version just the deluxe version tho this is an entirely a different situation tho,-
Why is it different? Because its a separate listing entirely with a different cover and stuff? Sorry im slow,-
"Because the 3am tracks only had 7 songs, it was clearly a deluxe edition that she just decided to release the same night as the regular album. This is 15 new songs, more than an albums worth. It’s a double album. Edit: and Taylor herself stated this. This is an anthology, a double album. The 3am tracks were just deluxe tracks for Midnights.",-
"God, I'll never forget where I was when that happened.",-
I was on the toilet,-
I can’t believe we finally got it right. 😂😂😂,-
Shes like im going to let them clown so hard that everyone will think they are nuts And then do exactly that,-
I think she absolutely did this because we wanted her to!,-
"Now let's be honest. The writing was on the walls She must have thought ""let's make this one easy, they never get it right""",-
"I love her, she's ruining my life",-
Guys. I’m a mom. I’m so tired. Idk if I can do a whole nother album tonight. 😭,-
We won’t judge you if you listen tomorrow. I think that’s what I’m going to have to do,-
Thank you. I needed that reassurance. I can’t fully appreciate while I’m in this state. Haha,-
The album isn’t going anywhere. Get some sleep and enjoy it fully in the morning 🤗,-
Am I the only one who’s so happy this did not get leaked anywhere??? 😭😭😭😭😭,-
right like that would’ve been so upsetting if the surprise got ruined,-
"Guess it wasn’t on any physical copies so pretty much impossible to get leaked unless an employee from Spotify or Apple Music leaked. If either of those companies leaked, she probably wouldn’t work with them again",-
I think she did it on purpose because cds and that kind of stuff is bound to leak but we don’t know what the cds and vinyls look like.,-
This second part is a totally different vibe and I love love love it.,-
It seems like TTPD is divided into an A and B side from how the tracks are divided. Two district vibes.,-
It’s like chaotic Folklore and it is everything.,-
I was hoping for a midnights/folklore hybrid… got it!!,-
Yeah it’s so much better!!!,-
Right? Saved all the best songs for the secret half,-
I'm literally finishing the first album still bruh,-
"Same, I’m excited but I should get through the standard first. I wasn’t able to wake up at 5am.",-
"30 songs in one album. Is this a record or something? The work ethic this woman has is freaking crazy. I'm a 21 year old MAN going crazy over here. Not a swiftie, but respect!",-
31 because 13 because she insane,-
TTPD 16 songs TTPD: The Anthology 15 (new) songs 1+6+1+5 = 13 🤯,-
"For her, yes! While it's not the longest album she's ever put out (her re-recording of Red beats it by eight minutes) it is the most tracks she's put into one album!",-
31 songs beats Red TV by 1 song,-
"I only got into Taylor recently but WOW do Swifties eat good. My favorite band is Nine Inch Nails and we haven't had a full album since 2013, and I didn't like it 😭 since then just a couple EP's and a super short album",-
"The Anthology tracks are so far exactly what I wanted. Less Midnights, so much more Folklore/Evermore.",-
For real? I enjoyed this more than Midnights already and folkmore is my life. But I'll I've heard so far was imgonnagetyouback which I enjoyed but didn't get that vibe...guess I gotta dig back in and forget sleep exist 😂,-
SHE DID IT AGAIN!!! SHE SAID FUCK ALL OF YOU WHO THOUGHT YOU'D GET SOME SLEEP TONIGHT!!!!!,-
"She is completely unhinged and an absolute powerhouse. How she manages to find a legendary new move each time is fucking astonishing. I’m not even the biggest Taylor Swift fan (call me a folklore evermore girly who dabbles in her other bangers), I’m loving this album so far. She deserves her spot in history, anyone scathing or trying to take it away from her is as delusional as she is in the Matty Healy songs.",-
"LOL ""As delusional as she is in the Matty Healy songs""",-
"oh my god, she's insane (affectionate)",-
"shes was probably thinking all day fuck the leakers, im a mastermind",-
I’m gleefully laughing at the leakers on her behalf,-
West Coast girlies she did this for us I’m so HAPPY,-
i feel like a stuffed turkey,-
God I love being a Taylor Swift fan - this woman puts out so much content I just end up feeling like this,-
I always joke that this is why anti swifties hate us lol cause she keeps us FED and they’re jealous,-
Guys I’m actually losing my mind 😐,-
Is anyone even processing the lyrics??? I have so much adrenaline right now I can’t listen properly lmaoo,-
All I could talk about on TikTok was all the two’s 😭 I knew it was going to be a double drop at 2am,-
And the album is now 2 hours and 2 minutes,-
She just rhymed fuckin Aristotle and Grand Theft Auto,-
the way we got taylor namedropping gta before gta 6-,-
Any place got the lyrics up yet? My ADHD ass needs subtitles,-
Fuck me.,-
Up Florida.,-
"I'm having flashbacks to Midnights release day: A bit underwhelming listen of the initial album and then boom, new tracks. Liked the 4am tracks more, we'll see about these.",-
My husband trying to fall asleep as I actually screamed. She is insane for this,-
I fully slapped mine in the face. I was trying to tap his shoulder but all's fair in love and poetry.,-
Taylor it’s past our bedtimes,-
Millennial swiftie here. We are just so lucky we have grown up along WITH her. Time is flying but we are all growing up and maturing together. First crushes. First breakups. Moving away from home. Missing parents. Bullies. Serious relationships. Happy. sad. Anxious. Mad. We’ve all been through it together. Album is everything I didn’t know I needed. Haven’t been this excited and seen in an album since like Speak Now at 17yo!! This one was for us.,-
Glad the ✌️ was more than the Fortnight CD. Would have been an overly elaborate hint otherwise,-
Is this woman not the best thing that ever happened to us?!,-
I KNEW IT! FROM THE PEACE (2) SIGN IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT I KNEW IT,-
Down Bad fuck it if I can’t have sleep,-
My boyfriend is so supportive of my crazy rn. Really went “HOLY SHIT SHES INSANE” and he’s like “😃😃😃”,-
Is everyone ok mental health check in are we still alive any casualties? Can someone go see if matty healy is still with us?,-
We don't need to check on him let him be wherever he is 🙏,-
We weren’t clowning for once!!!!🤍🤍🤍🤍,-
I WAS HEREEEEEEEEEE,-
As a newer Swiftie and night shift worker I'm having a great time.,-
"REST IN PEACE ME, RIP ME, I DIED DEAD.",-
It's the Dessner Anthology! She reserved almost all Aaron tracks for this one. How I love hearing the drums and guitars on So High School and The Bolter! Quintessential Tay I must say. The Anthology could actually pass as a woodvale album!,-
'Oh my god she's insane',-
DEAR GOD. 31 SONGS. CRYING OVER HERE.,-
WE STAYED FOR THIS AND WE WERE RIGHT IM DEAD,-
A FULL B SIDE BASICALLY!? WTF. Does this count as TS12 or is still part of TS11 but it becomes her longest album ever?,-
Definitely TS11 still!,-
"A good day to be in New Zealand, enjoying a nice 6pm listen before I go out",-
RIP anyone who bought all four physical versions 😅,-
Absolutely flabbergasted. Can’t believe I’ve been midnightst again,-
Anyone else loving the anthology more than the original album? Lol,-
On first listen I like the vibe of the tracks with Aaron Dessner way better than the Jack Antonoff ones.,-
"He looks like such a friendly dude, it’s hard to believe this is the same dude who made the most psychotic faces in No Way Home, The Lighthouse, etc. Dude has incredible range.",-
"In those movies, Willem was on a sabbatical.",-
Yup he was being Da Foe.,-
Honey,-
Actors who play the worst villians are usually the chillest people irl.,-
"Apparently Louise Fletcher, who specialized in evil characters (Nurse Ratched in Cookoos Nest, Kai Winn on DS9 to name some of the more famous ones) was one of the nicest people in Hollywood.",-
Didn’t she win an Oscar for playing Nurse Ratched?,-
"She was also harassed semi often on the street for how well she did the roles. I heard stories of people being awful, and unfortunately you absolutely see people treating actors like they are the role they played. It must’ve been scary for her, and it’s lame it’s gotten worse w social media. It’s a damn shame someone can perform so well only to be threatened by people who consumed the media!",-
Can’t wait for Keanu to play Hitler.,-
Okay now I’m just picturing Neo in a duster with a Hitler stache,-
He's Willem DaFriend.,-
i think you have to be nice and personable to go off the rails like that...real sycos practice acting calm and normal!,-
You must be an expert on sycos.,-
ALL I WANTED WAS A PEPSI. JUST ONE PEPSI. AND SHE WOULDNT GIVE IT TO ME. JUST A PEPSI. IM NOT CRAZY.,-
YOU’RE THE ONE THAT’S CRAZY,-
total sickos,-
"And incredible dick, if I hear correctly. Also for featuring in films.",-
"An incredible dick literally, not figuratively.",-
“Confusingly large” if I recall the quote from the director correctly.,-
"He has the face of the skinny stoner smoker dude in HS with a hot GF as you sat there wondering how this scrawny, poorly dressed loser could pull such a hot chick. It was the dick. We always knew. We just didn't want to admit we knew.",-
I'm always surprised you guys talk about his penis without having seen it. You can. It's a Google search away. Innallnits dancing glory.,-
"Man i got war flashback from antichrist, clit getting cut by scissors and cock bleeding scenes in particular.",-
I heard they had to use a dick double on Antichrist because it's so massive it was disturbing the film crew. Willem hangs serious dong.,-
"Just watch any of his interviews, Willem is the perfect grandpa",-
Willem Dafriend if you ask me,-
Was the picture taken by J.J. Abrams?,-
Abrams using an iPhone. Does this happen with Android phones too? Genuine question because I hate how this happens every time there's lights in the dark.,-
"It happens when your lenses are (even slightly) dirty from fingerprints or else, you can check it out yourself at night by cleaning it with a shirt/towel and see the difference it makes! That's why I always clean my lenses with what I can before taking a picture with my S21(android)",-
"No, Willem Dafoe just descended from his UFO to take pictures with this guy. You were wondering if there are aliens walking amongst us? Here's the evidence. Edit: Can someone show this proof to Joe Rogan btw?",-
Willem DaUFOe,-
"Not on my Android Pixel. As someone else mentioned it can happen to some degree if your lens is like, super dirty, but A) the phone warns you about the lens and B) Frankly even when I have the warning I don't get this bad of glare at all. Just my experience mind you",-
It happens with any device Abrams uses. It's like a superpower.,-
Believe it or not they actually shine a flashlight at the lens in all those lens flare shots. Edit: missing a etter,-
Nah just the guy taking the pictures has astigmatism,-
"“You know, I’m something of an Abrams myself.”",-
"Saw the image and popped into the comments to make this joke. I'm 32 minutes too late as always, Reddit.",-
I saw that Fringe episode...,-
He is now Willem Dafriend,-
"Shouldn’t it be Willem Daquaintence? I mean, friend is kind of overestimating the relationship if you just take two pictures…😳",-
Not with that Willem Dattitude.,-
Ah yes vintage meme,-
Here take my upvote and get lost,-
Take Dafoe-kin upvote,-
"He met Willem, da vrai.",-
I can't upvote this more than once.,-
"You know, I'm something of a pedestrian myself...",-
,-
I adore how the expression of you both makes It kind of looks like William Dafoe met you...,-
lol i mean he did,-
r/technicallythetruth,-
"Yes, it seems William Dafoe is more eager to take the picture than OP.",-
"“Dude, I'm literally the guy from that meme!” “Okay, dude, whatever, just let's get this done with.”",-
"“Funny thing about Willem Dafoe, his name kinda sounds like a frog talking to a parrot.”",-
Willem…..,-
Da Foooooe!,-
Willem,-
Da Foooooe,-
WILLEM!,-
DA FOOOOOE!,-
r/UnexpectedHIMYM,-
100% expected.,-
I hope you had something nice to say about his lobster,-
"I’ve seen it , your fond of me lobster..",-
HARK TRITON HARK,-
"THOMAS, YER A DOG! A FILTHY DOG! A DOOOOOG!",-
I dunno why but the second picture with his eyes closed made me smile so big,-
My favorite part is unironically the guy in the background eating out of a whole pizza box as he walks.,-
He should be the next Joker,-
"Honestly, I would pay good money to see him play Joker. A Joker at his end of life who got one last prank to pull. Make it happen WB, you fucking cowards.",-
Or just that scene on the rooftop where he's telling a joke to batman.,-
I hate you for putting this idea in my head. Now I know it's one of my wishes where I'll never see it happen.,-
Dafoe: I’m something of a comedian myself,-
"Well, Green Goblin, was basically Spidermans Joker",-
"He could play almost any Batman villain to perfection, even a few of the ones with boobs. The only one out of the question really, I think, is Bane. How about one we don't see mentioned a lot in dream casting: Clayface. You bet your ass Dafoe could do a mean Clayface. Granted, if there's ever a live action Clayface it's almost certainly going to be Andy Serkis for reasons (which, fine), but the point remains.",-
"In Joker 3, he will be the true joker and calls Phoenix joker a phoney.",-
William dafoe needed a body double because his dick was too big Besidesthat congrats,-
Willem DeHog,-
👌 I was only checking the comments to make sure that piece of trivia gets mentioned in any William Dafoe post,-
"Most men have to deal with baseless accusations of having a tiny dick, Defoe gets a personal army making sure everyone knows he’s got a huge dick.",-
"I think the specific word choice is important here, because it wasn’t because it was “too big”, it was “confusingly large”. His dick is so big it induced confusion in a room full of people. Other humans weren’t sure what to do in the presence of this thing.",-
Didnt he lose that in The antichrist?,-
A favorite actor ever,-
Certainly one of the actors ever,-
Often considered among the actors of all time.,-
People say he’s unattractive when compared to other generic Hollywood actors but you can still tell he’s one handsome motherfucker when compared next to an average human being,-
This is where my brain lands when I hear that name. That or flying around fighting spiderman,-
Loved him in Boondock Saints but the first thing to come to mind when I see him or his name is his confusingly large penis,-
He looks innocent and nice while also looking like an evil conman.,-
You're on the sidewalk?!? I'm something of a pedestrian myself.,-
Are you sort of a scientist yourself too?,-
"I can just hear, “Spider-Man”",-
Ha ha ha ha ha evil deranged voice,-
The confident smile of the carrier of 8.5 inches,-
He's hunting spiderman,-
"DaFoe is just amazing. Great actor, seems like a decent human being, which, honestly is the bare minimum we can hope for on terms of celebrities/rich. I'm saying that cause I don't really know that much about him, he seems nice. I have no clue if there're darker things about him that I'm not aware of.",-
He genuinely seems happy to have that picture taken. Willem DaAwesome.,-
