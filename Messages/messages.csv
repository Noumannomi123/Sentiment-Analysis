"He looks like such a friendly dude, it’s hard to believe this is the same dude who made the most psychotic faces in No Way Home, The Lighthouse, etc. Dude has incredible range.",-
"In those movies, Willem was on a sabbatical.",-
Yup he was being Da Foe.,-
Honey,-
Actors who play the worst villians are usually the chillest people irl.,-
"Apparently Louise Fletcher, who specialized in evil characters (Nurse Ratched in Cookoos Nest, Kai Winn on DS9 to name some of the more famous ones) was one of the nicest people in Hollywood.",-
Didn’t she win an Oscar for playing Nurse Ratched?,-
"She was also harassed semi often on the street for how well she did the roles. I heard stories of people being awful, and unfortunately you absolutely see people treating actors like they are the role they played. It must’ve been scary for her, and it’s lame it’s gotten worse w social media. It’s a damn shame someone can perform so well only to be threatened by people who consumed the media!",-
Can’t wait for Keanu to play Hitler.,-
Okay now I’m just picturing Neo in a duster with a Hitler stache,-
He's Willem DaFriend.,-
i think you have to be nice and personable to go off the rails like that...real sycos practice acting calm and normal!,-
You must be an expert on sycos.,-
ALL I WANTED WAS A PEPSI. JUST ONE PEPSI. AND SHE WOULDNT GIVE IT TO ME. JUST A PEPSI. IM NOT CRAZY.,-
YOU’RE THE ONE THAT’S CRAZY,-
total sickos,-
"And incredible dick, if I hear correctly. Also for featuring in films.",-
"An incredible dick literally, not figuratively.",-
“Confusingly large” if I recall the quote from the director correctly.,-
"He has the face of the skinny stoner smoker dude in HS with a hot GF as you sat there wondering how this scrawny, poorly dressed loser could pull such a hot chick. It was the dick. We always knew. We just didn't want to admit we knew.",-
I'm always surprised you guys talk about his penis without having seen it. You can. It's a Google search away. Innallnits dancing glory.,-
"Man i got war flashback from antichrist, clit getting cut by scissors and cock bleeding scenes in particular.",-
I heard they had to use a dick double on Antichrist because it's so massive it was disturbing the film crew. Willem hangs serious dong.,-
"Just watch any of his interviews, Willem is the perfect grandpa",-
Willem Dafriend if you ask me,-
Was the picture taken by J.J. Abrams?,-
Abrams using an iPhone. Does this happen with Android phones too? Genuine question because I hate how this happens every time there's lights in the dark.,-
"It happens when your lenses are (even slightly) dirty from fingerprints or else, you can check it out yourself at night by cleaning it with a shirt/towel and see the difference it makes! That's why I always clean my lenses with what I can before taking a picture with my S21(android)",-
"No, Willem Dafoe just descended from his UFO to take pictures with this guy. You were wondering if there are aliens walking amongst us? Here's the evidence. Edit: Can someone show this proof to Joe Rogan btw?",-
Willem DaUFOe,-
"Not on my Android Pixel. As someone else mentioned it can happen to some degree if your lens is like, super dirty, but A) the phone warns you about the lens and B) Frankly even when I have the warning I don't get this bad of glare at all. Just my experience mind you",-
It happens with any device Abrams uses. It's like a superpower.,-
Believe it or not they actually shine a flashlight at the lens in all those lens flare shots. Edit: missing a etter,-
Nah just the guy taking the pictures has astigmatism,-
"“You know, I’m something of an Abrams myself.”",-
"Saw the image and popped into the comments to make this joke. I'm 32 minutes too late as always, Reddit.",-
I saw that Fringe episode...,-
He is now Willem Dafriend,-
"Shouldn’t it be Willem Daquaintence? I mean, friend is kind of overestimating the relationship if you just take two pictures…😳",-
Not with that Willem Dattitude.,-
Ah yes vintage meme,-
Here take my upvote and get lost,-
Take Dafoe-kin upvote,-
"He met Willem, da vrai.",-
I can't upvote this more than once.,-
"You know, I'm something of a pedestrian myself...",-
,-
I adore how the expression of you both makes It kind of looks like William Dafoe met you...,-
lol i mean he did,-
r/technicallythetruth,-
"Yes, it seems William Dafoe is more eager to take the picture than OP.",-
"“Dude, I'm literally the guy from that meme!” “Okay, dude, whatever, just let's get this done with.”",-

HARK TRITON HARK,-
"THOMAS, YER A DOG! A FILTHY DOG! A DOOOOOG!",-
I dunno why but the second picture with his eyes closed made me smile so big,-
My favorite part is unironically the guy in the background eating out of a whole pizza box as he walks.,-
He should be the next Joker,-
"Honestly, I would pay good money to see him play Joker. A Joker at his end of life who got one last prank to pull. Make it happen WB, you fucking cowards.",-
Or just that scene on the rooftop where he's telling a joke to batman.,-
I hate you for putting this idea in my head. Now I know it's one of my wishes where I'll never see it happen.,-
Dafoe: I’m something of a comedian myself,-
"Well, Green Goblin, was basically Spidermans Joker",-
"He could play almost any Batman villain to perfection, even a few of the ones with boobs. The only one out of the question really, I think, is Bane. How about one we don't see mentioned a lot in dream casting: Clayface. You bet your ass Dafoe could do a mean Clayface. Granted, if there's ever a live action Clayface it's almost certainly going to be Andy Serkis for reasons (which, fine), but the point remains.",-
"In Joker 3, he will be the true joker and calls Phoenix joker a phoney.",-
William dafoe needed a body double because his dick was too big Besidesthat congrats,-
Willem DeHog,-
👌 I was only checking the comments to make sure that piece of trivia gets mentioned in any William Dafoe post,-
"Most men have to deal with baseless accusations of having a tiny dick, Defoe gets a personal army making sure everyone knows he’s got a huge dick.",-
"I think the specific word choice is important here, because it wasn’t because it was “too big”, it was “confusingly large”. His dick is so big it induced confusion in a room full of people. Other humans weren’t sure what to do in the presence of this thing.",-
Didnt he lose that in The antichrist?,-
A favorite actor ever,-
Certainly one of the actors ever,-
Often considered among the actors of all time.,-
People say he’s unattractive when compared to other generic Hollywood actors but you can still tell he’s one handsome motherfucker when compared next to an average human being,-
This is where my brain lands when I hear that name. That or flying around fighting spiderman,-
Loved him in Boondock Saints but the first thing to come to mind when I see him or his name is his confusingly large penis,-
He looks innocent and nice while also looking like an evil conman.,-
You're on the sidewalk?!? I'm something of a pedestrian myself.,-
Are you sort of a scientist yourself too?,-
"I can just hear, “Spider-Man”",-
Ha ha ha ha ha evil deranged voice,-
The confident smile of the carrier of 8.5 inches,-
He's hunting spiderman,-
"DaFoe is just amazing. Great actor, seems like a decent human being, which, honestly is the bare minimum we can hope for on terms of celebrities/rich. I'm saying that cause I don't really know that much about him, he seems nice. I have no clue if there're darker things about him that I'm not aware of.",-
He genuinely seems happy to have that picture taken. Willem DaAwesome.,-

"Rough break down of Pakistan's budget. - Direct defence expenditure 22% (actually closer to 30% because Army pensions and Nuclear programme costs are hidden into civillian sector.) - Debt servicing on existing loans 49%. Just paying back some loans which were taken out as far back in the times of our grandfathers, when most of us weren't even alive. Some current loans will still be paid back by your great grand children. After you take out these two items you are left with 21% of the total pie. Out of this 21% you have to fund: -Health Care -Education -Infrastructure (Water/Power/Roads/Dams/Bridges etc) -Pensions of retired civil servants (Big cost especially for military personnel) -Police - Subsidies for wheat, fuel and other areas which are imported, but full cost is not passed onto consumers. Due to corruption, misuse of funds and poor planning about 7 to 10% of the budget is lost or called financial ""leakage"". So in actuality, the Pakistan government spends about Rs12 on you, out of every Rs100 it has. For comparison, Indian debt servicing percentage is 25% vs 49% for Pakistan. They have an additional 24% of their budget left over to spend on their people.",-

"Then you have no right to call yourself a ""Pakistani"". Right?",-
Lmao don't even want to ;) And if u want to pay off the debts of thieves and looters just so u can call urself a 'pakistani' be my guest I'm getting the hell out,-
"Alright, but it's not about looters or debt. I'm gonna stick around because I love my country, and that's all 🇵🇰",-
"A very noble sentiment. How do you plan on paying for your loved ones medical expenses considering that public sector health care is quite crap due to being severely underfunded and understaffed (and that is ignoring the fact that most of the staff want to either move abroad at the earliest or are here due to family and have private practices). Otoh, the costs involved in private sector healthcare are truly mind boggling, a single day stay in the ICU of a decent private hospital can cost upwards of a couple hundred thousand rupees (especially if a patient requires a ventilator) and even that does not guarantee that the staff at the private sector hospital will actually look after your loved one.",-
"My brother, a person will die even having all these medical facilities. Tawakal Allah is bigger than everything. These kind of statements came out of mind who plans everything without considering that Allah is the best planner.",-
"Cool As for me I believe in give and take, My country won't do shit for me so I'll find a country that will :)",-
"Bruh this just some horny kid you’re replying to, look at his profile😭",-

And I left because I don’t like to be fucked by people who don’t do jack shit for me,-
"It will... If it's still standing, it will.",-
Hey man. Don't be that salty person on the internet.,-
I'm just being honest.,-
Mere bhai abhi Pakistani kehlwa ke apne ap ko konsa teer maar lya apne? I would gladly not be called a Pakistani if it meant getting a quality of life in a country that cares about its citizens lol,-
"Bhai Jan, yeh ap un muslims se phoucho jo India aur jammu kashmir mein hain k apna mulk kia hota hai. Har cheez paisa nahi hoti.",-
"Indian Muslims are pretty happy in India and wouldn’t trade their life for Pakistan unka bhi apna hi mulk hai bhai, considering they are around 200 million in number which equates to your total population lol. And besides let’s assume your assumption to be true to apke Pakistan me bhi na pak foj yehi kar rhi hai. Pakistan apna mulk kaha se hogya lol",-
Kum az kum apky ghr ki izat toh mehfooz hai na. Koi apko terrorist toh nahi kah raha na. Kisi bhi time kisi bhi waja se deport toh nahi krain gye na. I have seen examples of people living in US for 25 years and getting deported back to Pakistan.,-
"Best answer I've seen yet, very good",-
"Thank you for the answer. So the corruption is substantial, but not a huge amount of the pie.",-
"Corruption from budget viewpoint is substantial but not make or break, although it has a cumulative impact. For those that disagree on my point on corruption. The majority of corruption doesn't come out of the budget. When a police officer asks you for a bribe, he's defrauding you, not the finance ministry. Most corruption we face in our day to day lives is budget neutral. Our defence spending is the real problem, unsustainable and obscene for a country with our economy. Here are some major defence purchases of the Pakistani military over the last 5 years. -HQ9 and HQ16 Sam systems. Cost $600m to $1bn -7 Yuan Class submarines. $5bn spread over 7 years. -4 X 054C frigates $750m. -25 X J10 fighter aircraft. Estimated cost $1.3bn. -300 X VT4 tanks. $1.2bn dollars. Now these are just some of new purchases. Not upkeep costs on these or legacy systems. For example the cost to fly an F16 for one hour is in the region of $20,000. I'm not a pacifist. I believe in defence expenditure. I believe we should have a credible defence posture. But how is it justified that we try and keep pace with India, say for example, when our economy can't sustain it. We are heading towards the fate of the old Soviet Union. Being outspent, but still being addicted to unsustainability. Also its the job of the government to use diplomacy to lessen threats. But we are run by a military who have no interests to lessen threats. Lessening threats is essentially saying we can spend less on the military. Making the military smaller, thus reducing their influence. Turkeys don't vote for Christmas, as the saying goes.",-
"I was surprised last year when country was on the brink of default but boys were busy making deals for j-10 jets and tanks..it has been proven now that tanks are useless in current battle scenarios but our military is till following centuries old British battle tactics. Iran has recently proved that how effective ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones can be in comparison to a regular army, airforce and navy..Russia ukraine has done major damage to each other through missiles drones not through jets or regular army. Its surprising that we still have more than 2k tanks in service..imagine how much fuel alone would be needed to just keep them in running condition not to mention personnel needed for their upkeep and operation",-
It can be make or break. 10% is alot. Not to mention we don't even know what amount of 30-40% that is going to army has corruption in it.,-
"May I know what content you have consumed (e.g. Books, Videos, Articles, Meetups) that you gained this much knowledge and perspective on government workings and economy? Not just of Pakistan but the world",-
"Corruption is not biggest problem of Pakistan. Perception of Corruption is. Most bureaucrats will not do anything because if someone don't like them that work could lead them in trouble even if there is no corruption. Latest example was Ahad Cheema, there was no proof of wrong doing but still he has to spend around 2 years in jail because he refuse to do something he was asked to do.",-
"Are you actually defending a bastard like Ahad Cheema? No ""evidence"" was found for Zardari or Nawaz either yet here we are",-
Defense budget is mostly corruption. And all of the money spent goes through various levels of corruption.,-
"For starters it pays for their KFC meals. Saw a post yesterday about 15% rebate for Army personnel and their families. Now just imagine what corruption would look like on fancy cars, vacations, luxury items, etc.",-
this guy economics,-
Wait 49% for loans? I read 30% somewhere,-
"There's a Balance of Payment crisis in Pakistan where Imports > (Exports+ remittances+ foreign investment) so most of those loans are to equal that above equation and to debt service the already taken previous loans. It's a vicious cycle that will eventually break the whole system unless somehow exports, remittances, foreign investment is increased",-
It will be spend on future projects of DHA and Army budget.,-
"Corruption simple as that most of the infrastructure projects you see either goes to firm where either military generals,bureaucrats,Judges or often a combination of all 3 have shares along with some foreign company. These lot then quadruple the prices of existing services while in relaity not even spending half of that into the economy end product of which is you have s--t infrastructure with most of the money being embezzeled into the pockets of the aforementioned haramkhoors. This is practically how every single big firm in Pakistan works more or less and it's also why every firm and their mother are hungry to secure a government contract because ""easy money""",-
"People forget that debt servicing is also directly related to lumber one. If it was not for lumber ones' lavish lifestyles and gigantic retirement plans, we would not have needed that debt in the first place.",-
Mainly to the army......,-
Well their mansions in dha aren’t cheap u knw,-
"Debt servicing. And the debt is because Pakistan is addicted to living beyond its means. We've been a perpetual deficit country, with our imports far exceeding our exports. We cover up the deficit with loans.",-
"From what I've seen, it feels like most of the funding is channeled into projects in Punjab. Every time I check the news, there's a new project kicking off there. But here in Karachi, Sindh, our public transport is a mess. The Green Line on University Road, meant to be built with an IMF loan, is still unfinished, far from being operational. It seems a lot of our funds end up lost to corruption and mismanagement. Nobody here reports low-level corruption because we know it won't make a difference and might even put us at risk. Despite being Pakistan's economic hub, Karachi definitely gets the short end of the stick—crime rates are so high it's almost a joke, the roads are in such bad shape I'd prefer a dirt track, and mafias everywhere extort and prey on civilians while cozying up with government officials.",-
Lawaris Karachi 😔😢,-
"Expenses are alot, around $75 Billion dollars, while earning is less, around 30 Billion dollar, rest is covered using loans. Most loans goes towards paying interests of old loans + loans and meeting future requirement. Military made itself the center of Pakistani economy, biggest mess they created was destroying cheap railway, as they wanted to get revenue which freight train makes after movement of goods. Pakistan has around 100 Billion dollar worth of import/exports, so they thought we can make money if we control the transportation sector. They started their own private bus and truck services as Pakistan's transportation substitute. The issue with that is, it is too expensive because of fuel import and prices going higher. Pakistan import around $70 Billion dollar worth of fuel for 3 years. Current transportation system is just not sustainable for Pakistan, as it costs too much and doesn't generate much in return in the form of exports like earning dollars, which can be used to pay loans back. Military just doesn't want to give that up, as transportation sector also results in constructions of roads, highways, motorways which again is done by the military using NLC and FWO, 2 military construction companies. Around these roads military is in the business of real estate development, hotels, and food chain. So, they are basically exploiting Pakistan, with a really bad business model. Most of the loans are taken just to run their businesses.",-
you should know by now all that money goes in to government pockets and the army pockets. and the people are stuck with nothing,-
All goes to the so called elite class of Pakistan,-
Elites in uniform,-
Not just uniform everyone bureaucrats judges the media army businessman's politicians they are all one. One way or another and they keep fooling us by the name of religion different political parties pathan Punjabi etc they play the same game which Britishers left dived and rule,-
Don’t think Pakistan can take “hundreds of billions of dollars” - but yeah the loan is substantial.,-
Hence Pakistan has a 1 star review on its flag 🥲,-
How do you think the Generals and others get millions in overseas accounts? Tell me how they afford various properties abroad.,-
Parades,-
"This is a very simplified answer and there's a lot more nuance to it, but it mostly goes to these things: debt servicing, imports, salaries and perks of govt and military employees, subsidies and defence expenses. The state's relationship with money is different to an individual's relationship with money. For an average individual or family, saving up a pot of wealth makes most sense to provide a cushion for any unforeseen situation. For a nation's economy, money behaves like blood in the human body. It needs to keep moving. At a certain level, under certain circumstances, corruption at worst has a negligible effect on the economy. You won't die if you cut your finger, but if you suffer massive blood loss, you need to stem the bleeding and get a blood transplant. Pakistan's economy, over decades of short-sighted decisions, many of which were made to provide immediate relief to the poor as well, is bleeding a lot more money than it can generate.",-
New DHA Phase is coming,-
as my uncle says: tere asal walay baap ke jaib mai,-
"Subsidies and pouring into corrupt government institutions and national companies like PIA, railways etc Tax base is less than 5% and most people don’t pay taxes and expect infrastructure, education and healthcare like Switzerland 😂",-
We are taking loans to pay loans and the interests on those loans by taking more loans.,-
Less people are paying taxes which needs to increase plus Pakistan is taking loans to repay interest on previous loans.,-
is that even a Question We All (Pakistanies) know that All those billion dollars loan has directly gone into Sharif family zardari family and Army generals bank accounts,-
"Foreign remittance are money being sent to your own family, it's not money for govt to spend.",-
"Foreign remittance are money being sent to your own family, it's not money for govt to spend. Nonsense. You might send the money to your own family, but it helps keep the rupee value low against foreign currency. If we didn't have any foreign remittances, the rupee would be trading at above Rs 400 vs the one dollar today. Now imagine what you would be paying for a litre of petrol. Money coming in supports the overall economy by creating demand for rupees, thus propping up it's value. Thus helping our imports.",-
Wondering how long this country will exist ! 🤔,-
Sell Pakistan to overseas buyers,-
Military,-
There is no culture of tax payment in Pakistan. Private Businesses make piles of money and pay zero taxes. Only tax payment is either the one paid by salaried class or by some of the registered corporations rest is indirect taxation,-
Short answer :corruption . Long answer : corruption. How else do you think all these politicians & army generals have properties abroad .If you check the news every few months there is news of corruption of billion rupees in various projects across country & then that news either get suppressed or it fizzles out . This debt crisis wouldn't have been this bad if the ppl running the country had made sincere efforts to put the country on right track instead of lining their own pockets.,-
"I see a lot of claims, what I don't see are sources for those claims. How can we function like this? So many numbers being thrown around but no source for those numbers. Not supporting anyone, but if people want to have a fair discussion specially when you give stats, there should be sources.",-
"considering a 1=1 system, a debt taken today will be to achieve the balance of payment which has been in shambles as we are not contributing anything but are consuming alot ie imports >>> exports. this situation is detoriated more when each subsequent power that comes takes from it for their own uses . so the system is never 1=1 but 0.7=1 . the issue then comes that each inefficiency in return is surmounted in next loan and the cycle continues. however the biggest issue is vision. we are contempt with this model which one day will make the givers fed up and that would be it, we can cut on alot of things just to put something in longterm development, like some raw material industry or research ( this would require education system overhauls. imagine a rich university like NUST only provides 50k to research per master student, it wont be enough for basic things for proper research). so we are left with industry and raw material which is under mafia. so goodluck with this country",-

Lesbians...sometimes it's difficult for us to figure out how to stop.,-
"Me. My dick cannot, but my mind and will says I goddamn can!",-
If i can muster another hardon I WILL go three.,-
"Yeah, IF",-
3 rounds in a week for me.,-
"Boys when they are 18 : ""I can do this all day""",-
Even when I was 18 I couldn’t go straight away,-
Fuck that dude I’d get hard while still inside she thought it was sexy af…. God I miss those days. The best sex of my life is behind me 😭,-
Now you have to get into some kinky shit,-
Good thing there's more to life than sex lol,-
"This is the truth. My last three girlfriends have all been like this. All three of them have also felt the need to have a serious talk with me, ""Everything is wonderful, but I need it more and all the time."" Me: ""We literally did it twice last night and once this morning. I have nothing left to give."" I'll never know where they get the energy, or where the ""women don't actually like sex"" false narrative comes from.",-
"Ngl having gfs like this have made me realize I might be on the ace spectrum. Cause I would put in work. Their legs would be shaking, multiple orgasms, squirting, changing sweaty sheets. And they would still want more. Just made me accept that I honestly don’t like sex enough to put in THAT much work just to be told I need to do more. But also! Made me realize the massive disparity between the amount of effort women (generally speaking) think they should be putting in during sex. Real easy to go multiple rounds when you’re essentially just hanging out on your back",-
yeah tell em to stop being lazy and get on top lol,-
"Hmmm there is a happy medium. Lots of women know how to ride and suck a dick too and are happy to even the playing field. Makes me wonder how these women find men that go multiple rounds while only having to lay on their back? I end up with men that like my mouth more than even thinking about mutual pleasure, and then when I’m tired of that it turns into no sex at all… but I digress with my trauma dumping :(",-
Dude where are you meeting these women?! Everyone I've ever been with wants it way less than me. Like... Maybe twice a week. Maybe I've only ever dated duds.,-
Three rounds of 2 seconds maybe I can do it,-
woah buddy this ain't the olympics,-
"Gotta say, I’m glad I kept scrolling. Most of the comments were lame but yours got me 😂",-
glad to help,-
"If she is like that after 3 rounds, you are failing. My wife is sleeping after 1.",-
That’s because OP thinks it is round 3 but his woman is still on round 1. Poor girl hasn’t finished yet and bro has already rolled over.,-
"And the awkward moment when you have to explain "" look I'm a guy i need at least 15 minutes to reload babe "" also pro tip pop something for the first date",-
Don't pop something for the first date; you set to high of expectations and always have to take it. You pop it on the third adventure. That way she knows what your capable of but doesnt expect it every time.,-
Listen to this man. He is a strategist.,-
"I didn't understand what ""pop something"" meant lol. I've never popped anything for sex. What are you guys referring to?",-
"Honestly I’ve tried to ignore the refractory period, and it felt like something in my balls was being pulled taught and about to snap",-
"I feel ya I used to be sex addict once my balls got upside down, no jokes.",-
Testicular torsion.,-
Yeah I was scared I had pain for long time I got it checked out the doctor laughed when I explained and told me I gonna be okay!!,-
"pro tip pop something for the first date I'm going to meet a girl for coffee, and I just downed 2 viagras and a redbull Jaegermeister. Am I doing it right?",-
"“Sorry, this date can’t go on for more than 4 hours”",-
Probably cause you'll be dead on the floor of the coffee shop by then.,-
"Shouldnt be an issue, eat her, finger her, use toys, or whatever she needs to get off while you’re reloading",-
Then when you’re ready pull a Tony Montana “OK I’m reloaded”,-
"dont pop something if you're not sure of what you're about to do... these things also can have some nasty side effect, you dont want to have a red face with headache and diarea if you're just sitting for coffee.",-
You're getting rounds?,-
💀,-
This guy’s married.,-
OMG Who would have thought that the guy doing all the work would be more tired than the woman just lying there?,-
If the guy is actually going three rounds for you.Just dont leave him.He is working out there harder then everyone else,-
Girl laying missionary like starfish: “Why are you tired? 👁️👄👁️,-
yea because the girls dont have to move their entire body,-
Lmao you're getting pillow princess if 3 rounds is just you thrusting. At the 3rd round of penetration she got to ride you or you got a pillow princess.,-
It's the first time I heard the term pillow princess. Today I've learned something,-
"-""wow you are doing great"" -""i'm doing everything!""",-
writes down term “Babe…! Come here..! We gotta talk…!”,-
Must be well hydrated women who just lay there.,-
Its repost You guys still suck at cod zombies,-
I found this to be vice versa. Give a woman an intense climax and she is one and done.,-
I did 5 once — spread out over a whole night — by round 3 your spitting blanks 😂 but hey as long as she’s enjoying it!,-
"Trust me, it doesn't take much from guys to accept that fact, when every inch of your body is telling you ""you're done now"". Girls on the other hand oughta realize that a guy who lasts three rounds is probably on the magic pills. Hence the importance for men of knowing how to lengthen a round I suppose, rather than attempt to go for multiple ones...",-
This is why they are evil. They can think but still decide not to pay taxes. Gotta take the E-710 by force,-
The philosophical questions keep coming. Why do they hate freedom and liberty? Why don't they have a democratically-elected president? Why do they keep attacking Super Earth's innocent farming planets?,-
/thread,-
"Agreed, if these bug snowflakes think we're going to tolerate this sort of thing instead of their unquestioningly committing to managed democracy - we'll, we'll just have to show them a piece of our own mind from a well-placed Eagle!",-
"Us who just killed 2 billion: ""they can think but not for loooong.""",-
desire to know more intensifies,-
The bugs just don’t accept they spawn too rapidly. It is unsustainable for a civilization to advance beyond a certain point and not adopt Managed Democracy. Instead of coexisting and solving each sides problem. One being our reliance on E-710 for expansion. Two the bugs make E-710 on death and obviously aren’t using any of it. The bugs decided the problem is us and not them.,-
"And even after all that genetic modification we did to increase their breeding rate to ensure they won't go extinct while on the farms, they're still ungrateful. It's like they don't even want us to help them.",-
Right? They didn’t get that we were elevating them to better fit a spot with our society. Now they have flight and could be bug couriers. But no they have to be like children. Unlimited freedom without any responsibility. No purpose.,-
exactly.,-
Are they stupid? Should we even try to teach them our ways?,-
"Like a child, the bugs are too dumb to understand were helping them ""You are being rescued, do not resist"" 😈",-
"Or vote, they’re undemocratic",-
We were getting to making bug accessible booths but they had to rebel,-
Imagine having a functioning brain but rejecting freedom. Such a shame.,-
My love for Managed Democracy is only outweighed by my hatred for the IRS. That’s why I endorsed the Ministry of Prosperity because they know what’s right for my wallet.,-
Exactly. We make other species pay taxes. So we don’t have to!,-
"They don't vote too. Not a single Democratic bone in their body, not that they have bones, anyway.",-
They'll be throwing the E-710 into a harbour soon.,-
"Quite frankly, I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive.",-
Was looking for this,-
I think we need to hear fellow helldiver u/Certainly_not_a_bug's perspective on our glorious achievement of wiping out 2 billion Terminids in a mere 14 hours.,-
"I, umm, don’t think he’s with us anymore… you know, after the order",-
"Ohhhh. I get it, our fellow human helldiver is in cryostasis after being on deployment.",-
"Well, I do believe the after action reports list him as having suffered grievous injuries",-
"don’t worry, i’ve seen a few Helldiver vets toting around their cool new prosthetic limbs! i’m sure u/Certainly_not_a_bug is a-ok! edit: i after a except in whatever",-
"A healthy amount of E-710 is certainly necessary for the proper functioning of servo limbs. So, I’m sure he’s still doing his part",-
Of course they can think. They can think about me dropping from heaven to personally deliver them to hell.,-
"You mean ""dropping from the Democratic skies to deliver them to the authoritarian scapes right?",-
I think in game they used to be peaceful I think from in game lore but we came and they didn't like democracy so the only choice is death,-
"IIRC they were vibing but Super Earth wanted their planets, and then discovered that Terminids degrade into E-710 while they were genociding them, so they started farming and genetically modifying Terminids. I think they're also essentially lobotomized by the genetic modification, they used to be pretty intelligent and space-faring.",-
"I'm really hoping that somewhere down the line AH unveils the Terminid equivalent of a 'brain bug'. Perhaps a Terminid that's re-evolved their former intelligence, or perhaps a remnant of their original strain that escaped Super Earth's reach and has now returned to aid and uplift its enslaved kind. Either way I think it'd be a great addition to the lore and themes very fun to squish.",-
"Perhaps a Terminid that's re-evolved their former intelligence been tampered with by undemocratic forces to possess unnatural intelligence, or perhaps a remnant of their original strain that escaped Super Earth's reach and has now returned to aid and uplift its enslaved kind come to destroy our way of life, spread its insidious fascism to its liberated brethren, and oppose democracy FTFY. Please report to your Democracy Officer immediately",-
"Honestly i hope we lose in the end,it would put a fiting ending to the lore,and not many games as ever put the players to play the losing side.",-
"It's possible. We could lose in HD1, though when we did the game restarted, and losing was never predetermined (At least as far as I'm aware).",-
"I think they said something about wanting HD2 to be a continuous war effort, but I could be misremembering",-
You sound suspiciously like one of the bugs,-
Yeah I seen that someone said that due to experiments and decades of farming they devolved into their primal states. In the lore you’re correct about them vibing and actually didn’t mind humanity trading with them and stuff. IIRC when humans started settling their planets they didn’t resort to violence right away and actually diplomatically protested to super earth who responded with democracy and that’s when they went to war with Super Earth.,-
"What is the source for the reversion? I have looked and just keep hearing ""it happened"" but why would that be the case? I don't think they had any established line of communication with Super Earth before the war, they just were peaceful and chose coexistence. But they're still intelligent; the Bile caste of Terminids are extremely new, only arising from Super Earth's genetic meddling. In less than a hundred years, bile Terminids have developed support tactics with their abilities, including becoming *organic artillery*. They're also visibly quite different and likely have significantly different chemical profiles, but they are still accepted among the 'mainline' Terminid populations.",-
"I agree - I mean, this discord post confirms they have the mental fortitude to protest. They're definitely still sapient. Super earth reverting them to a primal state seems like confirmed head canon or Democratic propaganda.",-
"Its wild cause if super earth was even a little bit reasonable the bots would probably be our only enemy, the bugs and illuminate both seem to use legitimate diplomacy tactics and were happy with negotiating, hell I'm willing to bet with enough convincing the bugs would've even allowing us to scavenge their deceased for oil without needing to go to war.",-
"before Super Earth found out the terminids rapidly degraded into oil, they were clearing out terminids to access the oil supplies on the planets. Super Earth is a fascist entity that either eradicates or enslaves anything not like them.",-
Huh cool I love this games lore,-
I mean they still are space-faring Or do they magic themselves from planet to planet?,-
Could be neither. We know that they are farmed by super earth so could just be that every time they attack a planet it’s because they start breaking out of containment and rapidly breeding. Could even be controlled by some sort of hive mind which explains why they only attack connected systems rather than everywhere all at once,-
They didn't like filling out ballots! Unheard of!,-
"If they were thinking clearly, then tell me why I haven't seen a single voting ballot in the thousands of nests I've seen.",-
"Because they think and they chose communism. I think, therefore they die.",-
Hello? Democracy officer? I hear talks of ballots like some anarchists in defiance of our Managed Democracy.,-
the only thing i could think of,-
I'm just very amused by the whole idea of a swarm of Terminids holding up signs and picketing outside Super Earth government buildings,-
"/undiver Yes, it's implied in the first game that they were a fully-sapient species who opened with peaceful overtures, but when we discovered E-710, they became the next in line to be provided with democracy. Also, they had a queen and starships at the time, though I'm not sure if that's still the case.",-
Wait seriously??? I knew something was fucky with the bugs but you're telling me they were human levels of intelligence?,-
"Yes. The bugs and Illuminate were both peaceful, and didn't want to fight Super Earth. The Cyborgs were human dissidents tired of Super Earth's shit, trying to live their lives, and weren't so much violent just defensive. So the only appropriate reaction to all three of these factions was to bring them managed democracy after convincing all the citizenry they were threats.",-
"Yes. They were sapient and the first race that made contact with Earth, and did so with open arms - well, limbs.",-
"False, the illuminate were the race to make first contact with humanity peacefully, but super earth declined their offers of peace when they supposedly found WMDs in their possession. Bugs were found already on multiple planets and super earth spun a narrative against them stating that they'd mindlessly expand to our colonies if we didn't wipe them out first, but when you go to the bug planets, curiously there's oil pumps as an objective revealing the true reason for the war, wiping out the bugs so we can exploit the planets. It was only at the tail end of the first galactic war in 2084, 40 years after it began, that we discovered the bugs were the ones producing this oil, and is the only reason we didn't wipe them out completely. We've been farming them ever since for the last 100 years.",-
"the illuminate were the race to make first contact with humanity peacefully, but super earth declined their offers of peace when they supposedly found WMDs in their possession. I would like to clear this misconception. In the first game you can see when Super Earth declares war against a faction and then you can start dropping into their planets. There is also a little journal/bestiary thing that has the information. It is *HEAVILY* implied things went like this: The Illuminate: ""lets co-exist peacefully in the galaxy"" Super Earth: ""Ok, but in exchange for us not attacking you, you will give us all your technology and secrets that we clearly see from how advanced you are. We would like to use it to make better weapons, maybe even a planet cracker. You will also probably have to subjugate your civilization to ours, we havent decided yet."" Illuminate: ""What?!? No, you cant do that!"" *Super Earth turns to Super Earth Citizens* Super Earth government: ""They have WMDs and wont listen to reason, they are a threat. We must declare war and mobilize the Helldivers""",-
"/undiver we have been the bad guys this entire time, low-key super earth might be one of the worst fantasy empires in fiction for what they did to the bugs",-
The Imperium of Man has entered the chat.,-
"In some aspects super earth is worse The imperium kills all xenos, or at least when they can, but usually they just kill them Super earth has been breeding a fully sentient species to be slaughtered like cattle for a hundred years, devolving them and treating their sentient species probably even worse than how we treat our not as sentient cattle nowadays There's this 40k story which i find to be one of the most disturbing ones, where orks breed captured humans in extremely inhumane farms for purposes, and when a normal human shines a flashlight into the pitch black containment units which the farmed humans are being held in, the humans all just open their mouths, expecting to be fed, acting no different from animals That's what super earth is doing to the terminids, it's horrifying and outside of gameplay, i really hope super earth loses lol",-
Good! This means our psychological warfare is extra effective!,-
BUGS THAT THINK?!! HONESTLY I FIND THE IDEA OF A BUG THAT CAN THINK OFFENSIVE!!,-
"Consider this, diver. How would they be able to hate our way of life if they couldn't think?",-
They will NEVER destroy our way of life!,-
"Good, that mean they can afraid.",-
"Based on the lore, we used to trade with them.",-
"Wanted to site the source of this fascist concept. Below is a demonstrative example of a perspective shift in the scientific community. Aquatic and Terrestrial Invertebrate Welfare (DOI: 10.3390/ani13213375) ""A growing body of research has shown that across many taxa, insects are capable of varied cognitive capabilities and likely also experience emotional states such as stress [138]. The presence of personalities in insects and other invertebrates, including social species, has also been argued (Mather and Carere, 2019). The psychological consequences of such are that personality differences may affect differences in coping with stress [139]. Stress responses can result in beneficial effects, such as anti-predator behavioral changes [140,141,142]. However, chronic, repeated stress can also have negative behavioral effects, such as decreased diet consumption and weight loss [140]."" This must be discussed with democratic authorities to curtail further misinformation. It is important to question the unknown, but this does not include the class Insecta. They are an enemy to democracy and therefore lack sentience regardless of subjective experience and cognitive capacity. In light of this radical new ideology, should we not spread democracy at the door of our very home, Super Earth? There are insects in every biome, every city, every building! Surely, we must answer. Our way of life is at stake. Only sentient creatures vote. Only sentient creatures can be free. E-710 is democratic. E-710 is freedom. Spill oil. Harvest E-710.",-
"Please someone put the gif of ""he is afraid!"" From starship troopers.",-
"Yeah they've been confirmed sentient since the first game. We just don't care 'cause they're ugly and made of oil. There's a lot of... uh... symbolism in the game, y'know, people invading other people they deemed ""lesser"" because of their appearances so they could get oil.",-
Those illegal broadcast videos are looking less and less like a joke spread by fellow helldivers...,-
"Report to your Democracy Officer, Helldiver. Now.",-
The automatons quite literally trying to liberate oppressed workers on Cyberstan..,-
Agressive union tactics.,-
Who are the HD version of the Pinkertons? ... Oh wait.,-
I find that concept offensive,-
If they go with close to starship trooper lore the bugs not only think but were intelligent enough to create fire arms and interplanetary space travel,-
"Phhh. They can't think enough to push the ""door open"" button on those 'extract high level personal' missions",-
"""The bugs are invading"" Meanwhile we are consistently just attacking their homeworlds for oil. They are also evolving. Who else has seen the behemoth chargers? You'll know when you do",-
If they can think they must pay their taxes,-
"Impossible, all thinking species can see the beauty of managed democracy",-
Clearly never had a Charger look at you like it was gonna Pluck your Destroyer from the heavens before having its way with you,-
Looks to me like some freedom haters have taken control of our news. I'll be calling my local democracy office now.,-
Those filthy buggers ain’t people they oil to be harvested for my pickup truck.,-
Did you forget your training?!Thoughtless bugs Diver!,-
I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive!,-
Brain bugs are canon?,-
They can’t think but are fascist and a threat to democracy,-
Sentient =/= sapient a dog is sentient doesn't mean it can think abstractly like a human can. It means it can react to stimuli and feel things like happiness and fear but not be intelligent like humans are.,-
"Frankly, I find the idea of a thinking bug offensive.",-
Not after the bullets to the dome they dont.,-
"You read into these details too much, main takeaway, bugs bad, bots bad, now go shoot them, please report any of these questions to the Democracy Officer if you may have them again.",-
Thinking will get you 20mins at the reconditioning wall.,-
"This has to be in-game, seriously",-
Brain bugs? Frankly I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive.,-
As far as I know this is a part of the lore since Helldivers 1(haven't played but read some backstory primers).,-
I don't like all these treasonous questions on this post. Let's get back to wiping out every bug we can see! Always remember: only traitors hesitate!,-
I mean look how easily people attribute intelligence and human personality traits to their rodent-sized dogs....you think bugs can't be noticeably smarter than your chihuahua?,-
There is no such thing as a thinking bug,-
I mean how else are the going to have a sophisticated illegal broadcast we have to destroy. They can think AND operate a massive radio transmitter.,-
Ok but how do the bugs move from planet to planet? Are the borgs flying them around? Can they travel through space?,-
Comment deleted by user,-
"(Out of character, the bugs are about as smart as humans, they just function off of different instincts)",-
"""Bugs that think?! Frankly, I find the idea offensive!""",-
"Oh, yeah. In the Helldivers 2 Universe, but are completely sentient. However, Super Earth found out they bleed Oil, so put them into farms in order to harvest them.",-
"Think? Does the communist think? The fascist? Obviously, the answer is no. No thinking being could ever accept such flawed systems.",-
BUGS WERE ENGINEERED BY SUPER-EA....,-
Good that they are sentient. Now I know THEY KNOW they are choosing death over democracy. Time to manage some communist bugs…,-
A bug that thinks? Frankly I find that offensive!,-
IT’S AFRAID!!,-
Anything that has to sleep is capable of thinking - never seen a bug asleep though so this is probably misinformation 🤔😂,-
"Frankly, I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive!",-
"Yes, it's true they can think - but the only thing they think about from the moment they wake, as the first fire tornado appears on the horizon in the morning until the glittering lights of thousands of Super Destroyers appear above their world at night, is how much they hate Managed Democracy. We're doing them a favour by annihilating them in their billions.",-
They think? Good. In their final moments they can reflect on the misdeeds that brought them on a collision course with democracy.,-
"It's hyperbole, bugs don't think, the act.",-
"Brother, you are asking too many questions.",-
Propaganda. Report to your democracy officer.,-
But sir I got this message from my democracy officer,-

I belive this is the proof you need.....https://youtu.be/h0P19qdMMEc?si=zlPv5sloY_GceUff,-

"Yeah, they think undemocratically",-
30,-
Hang on i had previous messaging from command that the bugs couldn't think? they need to get our comms lines secured before i dont no which messages to trust Worried ship master of wings of victory,-
No. Bugs can't think. That's why they put it in single quotes. Please report to your Democracy Officer for questioning this,-
That's exactly what those damn bugs want you to think.,-
I think it the same level of thinking like when you hose an ant hill so nothing to major diver just keep farming them,-
"Just to be clear, sentient and sapient mean different things. Dogs are sentient, but not sapient.",-
"the bugs think that they can think, they are wrong",-
I have pet Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches and they have more character and better personalities than most people I meet IRL. Makes sense to me.,-
"Okay that's it, I'm done with the propoganda bullshit, bugs that think are cool and I'm joining their faction",-
It’s quoted because it’s not true. I find this line of thinking and question disturbing and am reporting you to the thought police.,-
"If north and south are based on magnetic fields on the planet, how does a galaxy have a west?",-
"No, they can communicate. And they're saying they're sentient, and that they don't like the genocide against them. But Super Earth High Command knows that's nonsense, which is why they're putting sarcastic quotation marks around those things, because clearly the bugs are just mimicking sentience (and since they aren't sentient, it's not a genocide). They aren't actually thinking, they're mimicking human communication to manipulate us. The real question is, who is spending enough time near them to hear these communications, and why are they recording them? Those people should be reassigned before they're tricked into having bug sympathy.",-
What? You're saying there's some kinda smart bug?,-
Yes we can and we think u are cool when not genocide us ( eradicate those little jumping shitheads asap ),-
Not after I put this 5.56 through their skull,-
Maybe they have an equivalent to the Zerg Hive Mind or cerebrates.,-
"??? temrinids can't protest, they don't even know what a protest is as a concept. Do you see ants capable of protesting ?",-
There's always a bigger bug.,-
Where exactly are these being posted? I'm on the DC and I can't find these posts,-
High command dispatches,-
It fits both the Starship Troopers and Ender's Game inspirations.,-
Not anymore. We bred that out of them.,-
"I think it isn’t that clear tbh. They focused on the Termicide towers, they siege, attack and guard vital points of SEAF's war industry like artillery and air bases, Stalkers try to sneak attack you, they call in more bugs when outnumbered, but... You can argue those are all just normal survival instincts. They don't like loud noise since they are seemingly blind thus they attack the towers, Stalkers sneak on you cause thats how predators get their prey, other bugs call in more of them cause that is like a self defense mechanism, yadda yadda. The Automatons are heavily implied to and the Illuminate definetly think though",-
Yes! And they THINK fascism is better than the Liberty and Democracy of our Glorious Terr---er Super Earth! It is for that exact reason that we will be harvested for Morki--i mean E-710. Onward!

They're Afraid!!!,-

Alien bugs,-
"I find the idea of a big that ""thinks"" offensive",-
I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive.,-
Of course it has to be this specific post that has the Germans winning the emoji war.,-

Really? They strategically deploy nests with specific troop types to carry out specific tasks that we are all sent in to counter. If they didn’t think we would be able to show up to a planet and destroy them completely in a few days like they’re ants that aren’t smart enough to identify you’re destroying their nest and therefore can’t do anything about it,-
"Yes. Originally the bugs were non aggressive and attempted to live side by side with the humans. But upon figuring out that war is unavoidable, they began to evolve and mutate into much more combat capable variants.",-
Thinking is undemocratic,-
They need to think to vote and it’s not democracy if they can’t vote,-

Ooooohhhhhhh I can see it already damn this is good advice,-
Also make sure your wig is placed four fingers width above your eyebrows.it looks like the wig might be pulled slightly too far forward. Try a wig cap and headbands to keep it in place. You can also use wig glue. Make sure the part of the wig is broken in. There are videos on YouTube of how to prepare the parts of wigs before you wear them.,-
Wispy bangs and some soft curls. Emphasize your eyes then lips. A bit of contouring your cheeks with a subtle blush. Ditch the watch add a dainty chain bracelet. So many things you can do. You can pull off so many different looks.,-
"I agree. Or if you like this style, you could just try plucking some hairs near the wig line to soften it up. There are a lot of YouTube tutorials that are really helpful ❤️",-
"I would also suggest a wig that has natural greys. Right now, the total brunette color highlights the fact that it’s a wig. A grey wig or a white wig will be more kind to your years, and naturally enhance your face.",-
Agree. Needs so wisp!! The current wig lines feels harsh!,-
Came to say this! A softer wig for sure. Something more face framing.,-
Eyebrows. Some soft blush and soft contour. Rose lipstick. All soft and natural colours. Maybe some brown mascara would be nice.,-
"To add to this- lashes. The full lash strip might be tricky - you can use the teeny little individual ones, I especially like to add them to the … the part of the lash furthest away from the tear duct (what is that called technically? 😂🫢) to give a nice fanned out wing effect",-
I think you can refer to that as the outer corner of the eye! :),-
the individual lash sections from kiss are so much easier for me than the strip lashes… def recommend!,-
This. I’d add that the front of that wig is a little harsh. Wispy bangs on a side part would soften this look up too,-
"I think to your point defining the eye brow and expanding the eyes with a soft brown shadow and mascara (maybe some falsies) would do wonders for softening the look. I also think a little color in the cheek and a soft pink lip would help, especially with the light outfit.",-
"Oh, and this isn't about your face, but skip the black watch and go for a simple bangle or delicate chain bracelet. The black watch and chunkier jewelry are for a different outfit.",-
"I’ve actually found more jewelry-type Apple Watch bands… bc I know once you get used to wearing an Apple Watch, it’s hard to go without it. But they make like bracelet type watch bands now to dress them up.",-
"I was planning on that, I just tried the outfit on to see if it would fit",-
"I really like the outfit on you, very flattering <3",-
It looks really nice on you.,-
"I think you should add some jewelry, specifically gold ones, to compliment your warm tone. To the face, maybe some lashes, blush, and contouring. Darken the hard features, highlight the soft features.",-
"I never wear jewelry myself, but agreed on that! I think OP would prob look stunning with some gold! And if wishing to, just some subtle mascara and some shaping of the eyebrows.",-
"100% with the lashes!! I would recommend small individual lashes, they're way more comfortable and look more natural, id say it's more beginner friendly than a strip lash",-
"trans woman here. Mascara is by far the most feminizing part of my makeup, which really surprised me. I really thought it would be eyeliner and lipstick, but nope.",-
Nails!,-
Second this. Blush will definitely soften the face. Contouring is definitely helpful too.,-
"Watch Lisa Eldridge videos on YouTube, she has really great tutorials on how to do softer makeup on more mature skin. I use her tutorials all the time and they're soooooo good",-
Seconded! Her looks are very soft and helpful.,-
Yes! I enjoy her tutorials.,-
"Shaping eybrow, some counturing and gentle lighting, and faux eyelashes",-
"A brow pencil and some highlighter would go a long way for OP, I think!",-
I feel like the hair style needs to be addressed. Something different might really help.,-
"I do have a couple of different wigs I can use. If you look at my profile, you can see some of the other styles I have",-
Long dark hair looks amazing on you !,-
"I'm sorry I don't have any real advice but I wanted to say that this outfit is SO PRETTY. Maybe search YouTube for makeup tutorials specifically for ""soft, feminine makeup""?",-
"Dude, right? Both the skirt and top are gorgeous. I wish I was this put together.",-
Jumping onto this because I came to say that I absolutely love OP's skirt!,-
"I also wanted to add that your outfit is absolutely beautiful. Also love the length and color of the hair. I've recently started following Erica Taylor on Instagram, she has great advice and tutorials.",-
I second Erica Taylor. Sometimes it’s very minor tweaks that make a world of difference. I like watching her because she has great tips for aging makeup which I need.,-
Honestly I wish I could look this good in white 😍,-
Same. Where’s the outfit from?,-
ChikWish,-
"Wait, they actually have cute clothes? I assumed all their ads were photoshopped and you'd get something completely different lol",-
Right??? And the hair? Gorgeous!,-
"I agree with a few of the other commenters, shape and define your brows (you can even get eyebrow stencils pretty cheap which can help with this) and I'd say either mascarara or even a thin line of dark eyeliner if you can. Eyeliner is a bit of a bugger to get used to, I find a felt tip style liner is easier than a pencil or gel, but use whatever you find works best. If you're still learning, I'd personally be careful with liquid eyeliner as when they gets in your eye, it huuuuurts.",-
I wet an angle brush and dip it in a dark purple/grey eye shadow to draw a softer eye line - eye liners skip on my eye lids.,-
"I'd maybe even try a nice dusty warm brown. It may bring some warmth in to really draw attention to your gorgeous eyes. That said, I really only do makeup for when I'm in the office a couple days a week and I'm lucky if my liner is even vaguely even so pinch of salt!",-
"Nothing too bold. Think soft pinks and peaches. Subtle glow, not shimmer or glitter.. Cleanse, close shave, toner, then moisturizer. Wait a minute or two between each step. Follow with a dewy foundation. You've got this!",-
"Agree with this! Get your glow and dew from skincare, and go subtle with the soft tones. I think cream products tend to blend and set more naturally on more mature skin. ✨",-
This isn’t makeup advice. Have you considered some wispy bangs that taper/curve? I that that could look pretty. Maybe see if you can borrow a wig in that style to test it out before committing to a haircut.,-
"Yeah! Agreed! Maybe try with a bang wig first! But, consider that there are lots of different types of bangs, I wouldn’t go too short or too thin. Again, you should experiment to see what fits you the best. Plus some blush can be nice. But not too orange or brown. More like what your natural blush tone is probably.",-
Brilliant idea!,-
Draw in some soft eyebrows. And maybe more blush and a more defined lip.,-
"Hi I’m a trans woman, the thing that will change your face the most is getting your brows shaped and filled. It really makes a world of difference that and I’d add a highlight to the inner corner of your eye and maybe some color correcting concealer to cover any stubble you have I like the one by elf since it’s cheap. That and you could add a very light touch of blush on the apples of your cheeks to round out your face but try to make it not too harsh and really try to blend it in. But you did quite well good job !!",-
"For the eyes: I think you should use mostly neutrals for eye shadow, nothing too shimmery or too matte, go for a soft glow, and don't go too dark with the colors. Add brow definition with a powder product and a small, firm flat brush, and try to find a product that isn't too dark, you don't want them to look drawn on. A soft grey/taupe might be just the thing, but this might take some trial and error. Matte eyeshadow or contouring powder can definitely work if you can't find a dedicated brow powder. Use a brown/black mascara for a softer look than true black. For the lips: Find a pretty shade of a moderately intense pink for the lip, and try cool pinks and warm pinks to see what suits your skintone best. For the skin: With regard to your skin, keep it sheer, and avoid powder except where you really need shine control, you don't need to deposit a thick layer of powder over your whole face, that is the kiss of death for mature skin. Use a creme blush in a pink shade that coordinates with your skintone and lip shade, and blend it out. Don't be too heavy handed with it, but don't be afraid of it either. For the hair: I would also take another look at the wig, if it's a lace front, I think the front hairline could use some work, it would definitely make the overall effect more natural and soft. The style and color is really good for your face, though, so you're definitely on the right track with the hair. If you have the means and opportunity, it might be worth going to a professional makeup artist to get their professional opinion on how to get the results you want. Sometimes it's best to get someone with a trained eye to offer solutions.",-
"Unironically, simple crossdressing or not, r/trans or r/transplace might help",-
More slightly arched brows and maybe some extremely natural short eyelash strips,-
"some lip color! i suggest a lip stain as it gives a softer and more natural look than lipstick. etude, elf, befit, and ulta make some awesome water based lip tints that i love.",-
I think definitely some lashes to bring more focus to your eyes . You could also over line your lips slightly with pencil and apply a high shine gloss .,-
"I would add a little more definition to your eye brows, some whispier hair, even longer hair, little more colour to the lips, I think a Pink or berry colour could look great, a peachy or pink blush will help too, and I would do a pin up eye look, can help feminize the look.",-
"Can I suggest a v neck to give a more feminine silhouette for your face, also a soft contour",-
some longer hair could help soften out the more sharper features of urs!,-
Lashes and blush honeyyy,-
If the event is outside a nice hat would look great with that outfit.,-
THIS,-
"I just came here to say this comment section gave me back the hope for humanity. Finding such a positive and genuinely kind place on the internet is wonderful. Y'all are amazing!!! OP, if you read this, your outfit is gorgeous and so are you! Every advice I've seen is a great one. I hope to see an update 💜",-
"I'm awful at makeup, saw your pic while scrolling and HAD to stop and appreciate your fit!! That dress is perfection on you!",-
"Don’t underestimate a good, bold lip to soften the rest of your features. You need a focal point. But yeah, a highlighter, some lashes and nose contouring are all helpful.",-
"I'm terrible at makeup but needed to state how much I love that outfit, you look so classy and elegant",-
"I think that less is more - only exception is going to the clubs in low lighting. A lip gloss, a very light dusting of blush or bronzer, a good lengthening mascara and you’ll be good, IMO. I do love your hair 💐",-
"If I can be so bold - are you on HRT? I'm unclear from your profile if this is your goal. If it is, it will do wonders to soften some of your more prominent features. Otherwise I'd recommend looking up makeup videos on how to soften the jawline and chin and raise the cheekbones. Also, something to make your eyes really POP! I would do a light eye (I love shimmers but make sure they don't crease), a nice liner, and a solid mascara - you could even try a natural fake lash if you're comfortable. You have a gorgeous canvas to work with. Personally, I don't think the hairstyle is right but I'm having trouble pinpointing why - it could just be because you're not made up. The dress is beautiful but I think the top you could go up a size if it's available - you can tell because it pulls across the breasts. I adore the neckline and the flowers on the skirt. You got this! ❤️",-
"Laser hair removal upper lip and some lip injections, microblade eyebrows. Are you open to these options? They have way to soften your face is to accentuate your other features",-
Just a thought get your eyebrows done.,-
Why not go to an Ulta maybe and let them give you some advice. Good luck,-
Smile,-
"I don’t know why, but I feel like a nice light cream bronzer would help soften up your look. Maybe a glowy/dewy face primer underneath makeup?",-
"I really like your hair, however, I think that a soft bang and fringe around the sides would be more flattering. As I have gotten a little older my lips lost volume, especially the upper lip, and I'm thinking about maybe doing some subtle filler.",-
"I’m transgender, and when I want to soften my face a little I go for different contouring tricks. There are great tutorials on YouTube and TikTok as well 🥰. Otherwise, at least for me, I love my piercings 😍 I think they help feminize my face a ton. I could see a cute nose ring looking amazing on you either side 😊 it can even be a fake one for the night. Your eyes are similar to me, so a cute wing eyeliner and some pink/blue/green eyeshadow stopping below the eyebrow looks awesome 😁 don’t forget the blush either, not much is needed. Just go for a light natural look right on the cheeks working up beside your eyes on the sides of your face",-
You could go to an eyebrow professional to get them fine tuned + some soft eyelashes and lip plump gloss is awesome for softening the face,-
Mascara! Try the tubing mascara it will help them look longer.,-
Comment removed by Reddit,-
"I’d suggest shaping your eyebrows and adding a pigment to them! I think having more defined brows are very feminine. I’m not entirely sure how to soften your features, but adding brows will definitely add to the overall femininity of the look! You look beautiful either way imo!",-
"So if Dr. Strange can see all possible futures, why doesn't he become a stock trader? Is he stupid?",-
Wondering that myself 🤔,-
Would that count as insider trading if the insider is you from the future? Plus I imagine that you'd run into some paradoxes.,-
"Yeah, as soon as you start betting on successful stuff you saw in the future the market will start changing and the sitch will be completely different pretty soon",-
"That's why you constantly adjust your strategy, this ain't no 401k that guarantees growth over 40 years- it'd basically be day trading, and having the time stone on hand means you can basically sit down for the morning and plan out the day's trades in paused time, accounting for many different possibilities. When you're checking the infinite futures daily for the sake of profit, you're basically the best market manipulator by default. I forget how the stone works entirely, but if the day came out to be worse than anticipated I believe you can basically undo the day and go at it with a different plan. Time powers basically trivialize life in a lot of ways, it's one of the few things I love to constantly think about in terms of how to use it in day-to-day life.",-
I think there are way easier ways to become rich using a time stone than day trading 🙃,-
"Maybe, but I like the complexities that comes with different solutions. I like working out many ideas, not just one really good idea.",-
That’s a solid mindset tbh,-
"Mhm. It's why I love the many magic systems out there so much, they're fun thought experiments! Side note, my autocorrect/autosuggest is having a fukin stroke for some reason",-
"Oh dude, I keep getting recommended this book series that has like the most solid magic system in fiction. But I forget what’s it’s called or who the author is every time 🤦",-
"He lives in a mansion in Manhattan, who says he isn’t.",-
"Well, he definitely earned his penthouse flat while he was a doctor, but I think he technically inherited the Sanctum via magic hierarchy so does it count?",-
Because that’s a small minded thought of a mortal who thinks earth money has any stance amongst the riches of the multiverse,-
"If you can grab anything from anywhere at anytime, what do you need money for?",-
Tacos.,-
"I CAST, SUMMON TACOS",-
Yep,-
"He has no need for that much money surely? The magical order he’s part of takes care of his necessities, he has a home, he can travel anywhere in the world (and beyond) instantly He was also a world renowned doctor- im assuming he has banked a lot of money",-
He used up all his savings attempting to fix his hands,-
jonkler stole all his money,-
the aslume is leaking,-
Hehe leaking,-
Maybe that’s what he did to make money after becoming Doctor Strange in Nepal since we didn’t see him doing neurosurgeon duties in Doctor Strange MoM,-
Doesn’t he have everything he needs as a sorcerer supreme and more? He already lived the high life as one of the greatest surgeons in the world anyway.,-
"The comic book answer is that every time he casts a spell, he has to pay a price. It's why he never fixed his hands.",-
He can probably just clone money whenever he wants. He lives in a mansion in the middle of NY so I think he's doing ok,-
"Pretty sure money isn’t an issue for Avengers, considering one of the founders was a major arms manufacturer.",-
"In the comics, no. In the MCU, definitely is.",-
He no longer has the time stone that allows him to do it. And I guess he didn’t think to do it beforehand what with recovering from his injuries and learning magic (which by the way allows him to open a portal to walk straight into a bank vault should he so wish),-
Have u seen where he lives?,-
attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual,-
“Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual” - Beyoncè,-
The guy lives in a beautiful house freely provided to him and can make any object he desires appear instantly. Does he even have any need for money? Does it even still hold value for him?,-
Meme so old they're still calling it Avengers 4 instead of Endgame,-
Yeah just remembered how they edged us with the movie title. Good old times,-
Back when we all thought that it would be called Avengers: Annihilation,-
Then some Artist accidentally leaked it on their own website,-
Infinity War II,-
Bro should buy some crypto,-
"Dr. strange has almost seen Avengers 4 more than I have seen Star Wars, respect my dude.",-
Sneaky bastard even knew the title.,-
Name dropped it on the sly,-
"He loved it so much that he saw it 14,000,605 times at lightspeed.",-
"No, he watched what-if episodes.",-
Ok nah nah nah WHO THE FUCK SAYS AVENGERS 4,-
The person who originally posted this all the way back when they didn't know what the 4th Avengers film was gonna be titled lol,-
And several millions of what if episodes,-
Worse-he gives spoilers! Argh! He ruined the ending of Endgame for me. I hate people like that! I didn;t want to know if they win or not. Thanks dude. You are strange.,-
"Must be strange of him, this may fulfill his role as the Dr. Strange literally 😛",-
Why didn’t strange make a portal to earth before thanos snapped so that tony and nebula wouldn’t have to deal with almost dying.,-
"With all six Stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.",-
Huh? Thanos wouldn’t care. Just give him the time stone and teleport back to earth (thanos will himself teleport to wakanda but I just mean teleport wizard style),-
"I mean, originally, the 2024 film schedule would also have Captain America 4, Thunderbolts*, and Blade (delays again). I think 2024 is a necessary break for MCU for both films and shows. After X-Men 97', we will have only Deadpool & Wolverine (film), Eyes of Wakanda (animation), Agatha (TV show), and Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider man (animation).",-
I’m very curious how Agatha is gonna go. Here’s hoping for the best,-
"""Suspiciously quiet"" has become a concerning description when applied to modern MCU releases. I'm expecting a ""delayed for reshoots"" announcement at some point soon.",-
While not too hyped initially at least the Wanda vision showrunner and writing crew are returning. And I guess now for the trilogy with Vision quest.,-
"Im cautiously hyped, I thought the creative team did some amazing things with Wandavision and it only really got shakey at the very end when they went all MCU bang bang pew pew action which really felt like the ubiquitous phase four corporate mandate for dumb cgi setpieces we would see in everything that followed. Hopefully with the current shakeups the creative team will be able to focus in on what already worked throughout these new shows.",-
"Wandavision's finale got affected by the early stages of COVID, which resulted in stuff being cut out of it and affecting the flow. You can easily tell something went wrong because all the supporting characters abruptly disappear and only reappear for the end.",-
But even then the bang bang pew pew action was really cool. Both fights ended in a very interesting way.,-
"I'm expecting a ""delayed for reshoots"" announcement at some point soon. It had reshoots already. But 5 days planned reshoots turned into only one day reshoot. Tbh, if Agatha really needed more reshoots, it would have already delayed to 2025 like Iron Heart did.",-
Def a good thing I think. They needed everyone to get a break from it in general and hopefully will start putting out better content. Super hero fatigue has always been a thing but no one cares until the product coming out started being inconsistent to outright bad. Also 97 is excellent,-
"Superhero fatigue is a drop in the bucket compared to mid/bad content fatigue. If the quality comes back consistently, so will much of the lost audience.",-
"Superhero fatigue doesn't exist imo. It's a quality issue. People watch 100s of hours of stuff like their favorite sports team or procedural crime dramas or reality TV each year and nobody cries ""fatigue"" but 30 to 40ish hours of superhero content comes out between movies and TV and people lose their minds and start with this fatigue nonsense. If the products were better, then nobody would care.",-
"I'm pretty sure it also has to do with none of the recent movies had A list characters attached to them. People saw the Marvels trailer, didn't recognize any of the characters, and said ""Meh, I can watch it streaming"" and didn't see it in the theater. Deadpool & Wolverine are the two biggest characters out of the X-Men franchise, it'll fill seats based on that alone.",-
"I really think it will be the first 2 billion dollar r rated movie. And I expect a quick labor day pg-13 cut before the home video to get kids to be able to ""keep up"" with the story.",-
"I agree. I also think that with current economic trends, we as consumers have become more picky with our entertainment and aren’t as willing to watch the standard MCU/superhero fare we’ve seen a lot already. Call me crazy, but I don’t think movies like Captain Marvel 1, Ant-Man 2, or even Shazam or Aquaman would be nearly as successful if they released in a post-pandemic world (all else unchanged). Those movies all released around the golden era for Superhero content that was largely led by the MCU. These movies can generally be described as safe movies that can be entertaining and will provide some cool mix of humor, action, and a decent plot. Simply put, those movies aren’t succeeding as much these days.",-
Agree. 97 is excellent and needs to be watched aha,-
We also had Echo to start the year off,-
Should have just continued the Spider-Man show that’s connected to the X-men show. Missed opportunity,-
"I mean, originally, the 2024 film schedule would also have Captain America 4, Thunderbolts*, and Blade (delays again). Feige stopping the whole superfreighter because he was going to crash in some icebergs is probably necessary. I really hope they are able to change the course enough. They probably felt confident enough with Deadpool to not be a fuckup: Beloved franchise, previous two movies were very good and successful. Kinda like the GotG franchise, having someone with a very good vision about it. I wouldnt feel as confident in CA4, Thunderbolts and Blade and i really hope they are able to bring those back ""in line"". The MCU from 2008 up to Endgame was an amazing ride. After that it was a very bumpy road.",-
they cancelled Marvel Zombies or was that 2025?,-
Marvel Zombies is 2025,-
"And still I feel that is all too much. I get making the wheel turn, paying people fair wages etc but it’s still nothing to get excited about. I honestly prefer if they resorted to type and focused efforts on the comics. Bring us new story line. See how those gauge with fans, try being new eyes to those comics and after some time maybe try adapting around that to the big screen.",-
Covid and strikes delayed everything. Next year we’re currently scheduled to get 4 movies.,-
"Which 4? I know Captain America and Thunderbolts, but what were the other 2?",-
Fantastic Four and Blade (I’m thinking that one is getting delayed again though),-
"I could be wrong, but there's no way Blade will release next year.",-
"You're not wrong. Unless it starts filming in the next couple of weeks, keeps a very low budget, small filming window and CGI is minimal, it's impossible for Blade to release in 2025. There's no finalized script and we're 1/3 through 2024! Ali needs fight choreography training, sets need to be built, costumes made and a billion other things needed before cameras can roll",-
"This is absolutely wrong. Most MCU films shoot 12-14 months before release and Blade is supposed to be released in November 2025 with a reported shooting start date in Fall and another reported shooting start date this Summer. It's definitely making its Nov. 2025 release. Plus, it seems they are keeping Avengers 5 in 2026, so they can't afford any more delays at this point.",-
I would not be surprised if Avengers 5 is moved to 2027 and Secret Wars to 2028 to mark the MCU’s 20th anniversary.,-
"I've been saying this would be the case for a long time, but according to DanielRPK and Jeff Sneider, very recent production grids indicate they will start filming in early 2025 and still release Avengers 5 in May 2026, while Spider-Man 4's production grid mentions a July 10th 2026 release date now which means Sony gave up trying to release it in 2025. That means Blade is not moving from its position, and 2025 will include Armor Wars, Avengers 5, Spider-Man 4 and Shang-Chi 2 which will also start filming in early 2025 and according to Simu Liu, it will be released between the 2 Avengers films. 2027 will most likely be Dr. Strange 3 in February which has been reported to be a direct set up for Avengers 6, then Avengers 6 in May and most likely X-Men and Midnight Suns in July and November respectively. Avengers 6 and X-Men start filming in late 2025 according to their production grids and Midnight Suns reportedly officially entered pre-production a couple of months ago with producer Stephen Broussard overseeing its production and Mid half Giacchino as the potential director. As for the series, we'll get Daredevil S1 in January 2025, Ironheart in September, Daredevil Season 2 (which will start filming in November 2024) probably in like December 2025-January 2026, Wonder Man (which has already been filmed completely) in Spring-Summer 2026, Vision Quest (which will start filming in October 2024) in Fall 2026 and Young Avengers (which is rumoured to start filming sometime in 2025) in Early 2027. Moon Knight Season 2 which is rumoured to happen as a set up for Midnight Suns will most likely release in Fall of 2027.",-
"I'm hoping it will make it's release date, but I usually assume every major Marvel project will get delayed for one reason or another... Actually I wonder how many Marvel movies released on time compared to how many were delayed...",-
"It is 100% possible to have Blade ready on time for next year I mean look at Avengers it started filming with only 12 months left before release. Blade doesn't release until November 2025, so they have plenty of time to get things rolling, if they arent filming by the start of 2025 that is when we can go yeah its not coming in 2025.",-
You are wrong. They have plenty of time. It will most likely release next year.,-
You are wrong. Do you care to explain why you believe that to be the case?,-
"Most MCU films shoot 12-14 months before release and Blade is supposed to be released in November 2025 with a reported shooting start date in Fall and another reported shooting start date this Summer. It's definitely making its Nov. 2025 release. Plus, it seems they are keeping Avengers 5 in 2026, so they can't afford any more delays at this point.",-
Hmm ... seems reasonable ... danke.,-
I’d be surprised if Blade ever happens at this point lol,-
"Nah, it'll happen. The character is fairly well known among the non-comics audience, and the previous films (though twenty years ago) were successful.",-
"It's crazy because it's such a sure thing, I want to see mahershala ali as Blade! It was a fancast first, for god's sakes.",-
"No way Blade is coming out. Mahershala probably leaves, how much longer can he wait.",-
"I needed the break in comic book movies, if im being honest.",-
"2025 is going to be pretty interesting regarding superhero films in the mainstream, especially with The Fantastic Four (& Superman for DC)",-
I think 2024 only having one Marvel movie and one DC movie (Joker 2) is a good thing. Next year we'll get bangers with Superman and The Fantastic Four. I think all four movies will do well at the box office.,-
"That’s fine by me, if it lets the staff breathe a bit and get back to running everything then so be it. Kevin Feige did say he felt he was doing too much all at the same time so now he can focus. EDIT: I’m gonna make it clear that I’m gonna ride this Marvel train until the last stop so for me personally, not having 3 movies this year won’t hurt me.",-
It'll be nice to give some space for the public to get hyped about Marvel again.,-
"Plus, Deadpool and wolverine, first rated R movie, a film that is supposed to tie the TVA in a more concrete way so people can start theorizing about what is going to happen in the lead up to avengers 5… there are a lot of things going for this movie. Assuming it is as good as everyone including marvel needs it to be, I would think this is a good film to stake the revitalization of the MCU on.",-
They gotta get the audience back into and need to rebuild the move hype train. Need to give us the good crumbs to make us want more. Remember when we’d line up for hours to watch these? Before reserved seating. They need that interest again,-
I watched avengers 5 times opening day. And I saw it a week early before that. I have seen most of the last couple years movies once...,-
Yeah the only movies i genuinely revisit are: Ragnorak IW/EG The Spider-Man’s Civil war Ant man cause it’s fun,-
Phase 1-3 were mostly rewatchable many times they were 80% fantastic+ imo. I funnily like most of the phase 4 shows a lot more than the movies.,-
That scene where Iron Man and War Machine 2v50 a bunch of robots was clean asf,-
I concur. Pretty nuts. This would have been the ideal year for Armor Wars or Blade.,-
"To be fair Blade was meant to release this year, but the strikes prevented that",-
The Blade delays started well before the strike.,-
Are we just ignoring a pandemic and two massive Hollywood strikes that completely reshaped the release dates?,-
Nobody was complaining there’s only one movie the person was just pointing out that this is the third time this has happened. Just a small fun fact. I think I speak more most fans when I say the less content the better as of recently. The biggest complaint with the MCU lately has been the overwhelming amount of content recently,-
Think it's a nice change of pace. Gives everyone some room to breath.,-
Yep they are taking a bit of a break and making sure the only movie will be something that will definitely be a huge hit,-
"More like an unplanned break like in 2020 where they had nothing, as lets not forget this year was meant to have 4 movies, but the strikes.",-
The cgi of iron man 2 was stupid good,-
It’s still good compared to the stuff they have been making,-
"CGI in Iron man, Iron man 2, and avengers is leagues ahead of some of the CGI they are currently outputting",-
Rewatching the Avengers shows some serious flaws in the effects.,-
*cough* black widow *cough*,-
Studios need to remember that audiences only care about CGI when it is bad.,-
"DC is also only releasing Joker 2 this year, and that's not even a real comic book movie. I think this is a good thing. We need a break from so much superhero content lately.",-
Sony is the only one who has more than 1 film,-
"Oh, I forgot about the Sony movies. Might has well scrap those. They’re going to be awful.",-
"The Venom films are pretty fun, they're not good movies, but Tom Hardy brings his A game to them. It's baffling to me that Leto, an actor known for... unique acting decisions, gave such a borderline comatose performance in Morbius. That was always going to be a turd, but if he'd gone full ham it might have been more memorable",-
"I think Venom 3 will be another fun popcorn flick, but i do think Kraven will fall mroe in line with Morbius and Madame Web",-
Joker 2 is based on two comic book characters (Joker and Harley Quinn). Of course it counts as a comic book movie.,-
You’re right,-
It's probably better to only have 1 movie. Let some demand build up.,-
Probably be a banger too. The only reason ironman 2 wasn't a knock out was cause studio pressure prevented Favro from breaking the mold like he wanted to.,-
"Good. Quality over quantity. Honestly this might be the hottest take of all, but after seeing 97' I wouldn't mind if the next version of the MCU is completely done in the same animated format. I prefer it over live action.",-
"The reception of X-Men has me very excited for the other projects that Marvel Animation has in the works, Eyes of Wakanda, Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Marvel Zombies.",-
Can’t we have quantity and quality? I feel a lot of the controversial decisions have been easily avoidable.,-
"That sadly is not really possible, even Feige and Iger have pointed out at the rise of quality as to why they haven't been able to deliver good MCU content in a constant basis. Thing is with the more content you have, the Marvel Studios crew will spread to thin, so some projects will get more attention to others.",-
"Apparently not. For whatever reason when we started getting more content, we started getting bad content. It was too much tbh. Not every character should have a solo series or movie.",-
"Sam Wilson has had the best transition so far. He was a side character for 5 movies. He was around enough and fun enough we all enjoyed him, but he was background. They set him up to really move into the foreground. I’m very mixed on Spider-Man. I loved all the movies so far, and I love that he had his whole coming of age arc. But I have to say that it kinda sucks that they got Peter so involved in tony starks life and have all these photos and this relationship where Peter was becoming a part of the team, to the point where Tony left the keys to the world defense systems in his hands, and they just kinda made it so he can’t really go back to that again. I really would have loved for them to have at least left Edith and a fabricator for him. It would fit in the universe, and not really cheapen the relationship with Tony like they did. I get him wanting to be his own person/hero, but Tony was a father figure to him and that should be a lasting thing— at least until Tom holland is no longer playing Peter.",-
Elaborate I'm interested in this take,-
"I think in order for everything to be of high quality, Marvel Studios needs lower quantity to give extra time and attention to each project. It's like making a large batch of cupcakes with a thin layer of icing versus a couple specialty cupcakes that get cool sprinkles and nicely patterned icing because the baker can dedicate more time on each one.",-
I wish they did only 1 or two projects a year. That way everything has more time to be fleshed out and better.,-
"Unfortunately that’s how you combat fatigue. Personally, the shows are what was really causing it. Was happy with their movie schedules. Maybe cut the shows in half and up the movie quality.",-
I'm fine with 2 movies and 1 show. Just focus on characters that need a show. Not Agatha or Iron heart which no one asked for.,-
I think this is the way to go for now... make this feel like events again!,-
"Maybe write a strong worded letter, that'll teach them.",-
It’s because everything was delayed,-
I'm not really a fan of Deadpool,-
hopefully they figured out firing at all cylinders doesn't matter if people don't like what you are putting out,-
The well is dry,-
Psh nothing gonna beat that awesome fight at the end of Iron Man 2.,-
I miss the scarcity,-
This fanbase made it vocally clear they were tired of watching content.,-
Watching bad content*,-
"Well people have been defining bad content as bad writing, but they've already decided Ironheart has bad writing before it's even come out.",-
I'm definitely not tired. I've been enjoying everything they put out,-
*The vocal loudmouth part of the fanbase Regular people just enjoy this stuff in their own time and keep watching. They don't go on reddit and whine about it.,-
"No they vocalize it by not paying to see it in theaters, as evidenced by the last few movies.",-
"Exactly - even if I was overwhelmed with releases vs spare time, I would still look forward to those moments of catching up.",-
Good. They need to create scarcity in the market again.,-
Not crazy. It’s expensive and time consuming. Get over it.,-
Originally 2012 was supposed to be Runaways and Avengers. Iron Man 2 was supposed to be post Avengers (originally 2011 but moved to avoid completion with Raimi spider-man 4). Dont ask for sources btw. This was 15 years ago. Google whatever I said and filter for articles published back then.,-
"Iron Man 2 was always pre-Avengers, the only Phase 1 films that moved around were Thor, Captain America and Avengers (Thor was originally June 2010, Cap was originally May 2011 and Avengers was July 2011)",-
"This fan base, I stg. Beat the shit out of the studio for fatigue two years straight, now lamenting a shortage of content",-
I wasn't one of those. They could release a movie per month and I would be elated. I think all those claiming fatigue over watching MCU are the casual fans and the rest of us are getting screwed by them being vocal.,-
"The directive to take things back and slow things down to improve the stories is going to make some epic future MCU films. The quality over quality strategy is gonna pay off for all of us. Still… I’m feeling all sorts of sad that we aren’t getting to see Blade or Sam Wilson in 2024. Also… looking ahead: Kinda thinking, unless Ironheart plays right into it, we might never get an Armor Wars (Rhodey deserves his own vehicle finally) All that stuff we were teased two or three years ago might never happen. Sad about that. 🫤",-
Armor wars needs to be rhodey dealing with his trauma of losing Tony and taking his stuff back,-
"It’s a good idea. Marvel needs to slow the hell down with their release schedule. Give these movies time to breathe. Starting in 2025, they should go back to only two movies per year, and no more than three Disney+ shows imo.",-
"I have my doubts they will go back to 1-2 films permamently, 3 films is the more likely option if they want to downsize their output.",-
And yet somehow everyone's saying that there's superhero fatigue. I'm not tired of superhero movies. Not at all. I'm tired of bad ones.,-
They also sat out 2009,-
"To be fair, they've released 2 shows this year and they're apparently releasing 3 more",-
I find it bat shit insane y'all are used to getting 6 movies a year and getting upset like Violet Beauregarde when she can't have it NOW.,-
There wasn't a single movie in 2020.,-
It's been nice. Able to catch up on the MCU,-
FACTS,-
The first 2 cases are understandable. The MCU was still in the beginnings.,-
Do you think it will actually air this year? A lot of movies have been delayed. We can also remember the Holywood drama last year.,-
"It’s like with candy or any treat: if you only get them every now and then, they are special. If you get them every day, they won’t be special anymore.",-
Each of these years did have a non-MCU marvel movie release the same year though. 2009 - X:Mem Origins: Wolverine 2012 - The Amazing Spider-Man 2024 - Madame Webb + Kraven the Hunter + Venom: The Last Dance,-
This is marvels last chance for me honestly. Fingers crossed they don’t make the movie about some new lane character that’s way overpowered.,-
is it true that their revenue has dropped? and their movies aren't selling as well?,-
Really shouldve always been this way. Or maybe at least just 2 products a year tops,-
We live in strange times. The Popcorn buckets and trailers get more buzz than the theatrical release. What is going on??,-
"I definitely am not getting superhero fatigue - but I'm really happy for them to space out the films more. One film in a year, build up the anticipation, don't get too tired of it all. Brill.",-
"It's not a bad thing though, besides we got a bunch of Disney+ shows coming our so it's not that big of a deal.",-
The movie trailer is out and no one has posted it on Reddit.,-
Quality vs Quantity,-
"Easy, Ranch. Less is more.",-
Appreciated. I’m still trying to get caught up!,-
"Common dude, Its Deadpool Its gonna rock anywayz",-
"I think it can only be a good thing. I do love having multiple movies and shows to see each year, but we want quality content and it's clear we haven't been getting it. If getting quality means having some years with only one movie and one D+ show then that's fine by me.",-
"good, theyve done fuck all for 5 years",-
"I'm not surprised... a LOT of Egos had to be stroked and pet projects had to be shoved down throats, to prove that the last 4 Marvel movies were krap and had little to none fan base to get audience in seats. The core heros will always be a draw... we grew up with them! We've been telling 'em for years, but 'F' and Company just weren't listening. Now that wallets are much lighter... maybe, just maybe, they've finally figured it out.",-
"Looks like that's a good thing the MCU is taking a break to release one movie a year so it can take its time or if they rush it again they're gonna keep failing the quality of THE CGI,special effects and the plot. I'm hype for those UPCOMING MCU movies, especially Deadpool & Wolverine it's going to be million times better then Sony spider-man universe",-
Deadpool isn’t marvel owned if I understand. It was a break out hit that made marvel want to own the IP.,-
"It is Marvel owned, Marvel got the rights to all of the Fox Marvel characters back in 2019 when the merger happened. Giving them access to Fox iteration of the X-Men",-
I for one cannot wait for the 9874632th movie about the same thing as all the prior movies with climax after half-emotional climax for four hours straight.,-
And the funny thing is technically it’s a sequel to a Fox property so not even 100% an mcu movie (yea yea ik deadpool is gonna go to the MCU universe in this movie),-
Oh love 💔😭 no words can describe how hard the situation is 💔 sitting helplessly watching is killing me 😭,-
Your life matters. Millions of people are watching and marching and calling and crying with you. ❤️,-
"Mariam, I am a Christian from the USA. My heart bleeds for you. No matter what the politicians might say, I have not had a face-to-face encounter with an American who isn’t outraged at our government’s support of these atrocities. The common people of the world stand with you ❤️",-
لماذا تفضل الموت هو ما يقدمه الإسلام. لماذا تضطهدون اليهود الذين لا يريدون سوى العيش في وطنهم؟,-
I don’t even know what to say Mariam other than I’m so sorry. Praying that you stay as safe as possible. Do you have a GoFundMe or anywhere we can donate to help you?,-
"They will say that there's no other way cos of Israel. Yet there's examples of non violent protests Even Pro Palestinian marches around the world are violent compared to others What's the common denominator? The religion. Which other Religion had as it's Prophet, a sex crazed warlord? Which other religion had guidelines on what to do with captured wives of fallen soldiers Which other religion allows a man multiple wives The 'best' is hearing them try to justify the above.",-
"You're getting downvoted for speaking the Truth. An uncomfortable Truth. All around the world Hamas, Isis, 'normal' Muslims are killing and trying to convert everyone to Islam but cry foul when the world fights back. Not once did she ask Why did Hamas do this. Not once did she speak about how they murdered and raped. Remember it's in their texts to wipe out all non-believers. I bet soon will be a GoFundMe. I'd support her as a human being as I would the victim's of Islam but it's hard to feel pity when she doesn't condemn Hamas nor see how they started this and placed her in the situation she's in. She too will put money first like the Egyptians taking cash to let them in.",-
Mariam I can’t even imagine the pain and heartbreak you feel. Please know that citizens of the world are screaming for you and we will never stop. Your life matters so so much to us. From the river to the sea Palestine will be free.,-
Looks like the Zionists want to colonize the thread. Don’t worry Mariam there is more of us than them. 75% of the United States is trying everything we can to stop the genocide and end the apartheid. Everyone is talking about you everyone wants you to live.,-
"Your life does matter. It matters to me, and it matters to many others who see what’s going on. We are not ok with it. It is unacceptable, and you didn’t do anything to deserve it. I am sending you all the love and strength I have.",-
"I am really ashamed, sad",-
"I’m so so so sorry. This world has not been kind to humanity, know that many Americans including myself ache for your pain. I’m so sorry. 💔",-
"Mariam… I don’t know you… and you don’t know me. But I cry for you every day. I pray for you every day. If I could take away all your pain, I would do it in a heart beat. Please, if you need even someone to just talk to. Feel free to message me. My heart is with you, now. And forever",-
I am so so sorry. I want you to know you have so many people fighting for you all. Even here in the US. I am disgusted by my government and I hope we can vote out a lot of these zionists for a more pro-Palestinian government going forward.,-
I am so sorry for what you are all going through in Gaza. It is disgraceful that the gutless politicians are not standing up to evil Netenyahu. I'm from England are there are protests and marches every weekend. I am appaulled by our useless government. I work for a charity that supports work in Gaza and West Bank. I think about you all the time and wish we could do more. Please know that the whole world is on your side.,-
"Mariam, All over the world, people are watching and feeling your pain. The world is with you, and history will judge us for this madness I feel so useless, I can't believe we are witnessing your suffering without being able to stop it . We are failing you, and I have no words to express my shame Please, know my dear Mariam that we love you deeply and each and every single one of you matters. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry...",-
❤️❤️❤️❤️,-
We will fight for you. Millions around the globe are rising up to this monster. It won’t end well for Israel.,-
Milions that support terror just becouse stopid and naive . Try to think logicaly this terror will come to you becouse jihad is they only way of the radical islam. So pitty,-
"The US and Israel fund Al nusra which is alqaeda and ISIS. Research it, they don’t deny it. So by your logic, all Americans and Israelis are fair game to be killed - because they support terrorism.",-
"Where do you get this nonsense from? The USA killed bin Laden. You have a hard time finding logic in radical Islam, that's understandable. Start checking which people value human life and which value terrorism and jihad",-
"Here you go: https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-gives-secret-aid-to-syrian-rebels-1497813430 Here: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna829201 Here’s Al qaeda fighters waking up in Israeli hospitals: https://youtu.be/fwbHKpbiNAc?si=WrAmKcFdeTxMRSVG Just research how we fund al nusra, which is subsidiary of alqaeda. It’s not really a secret anymore. All done to fight the Syrian govement and bashar al Assad. 😉",-
Al qaeda Isis Hamas ..are all pure evil is good for the normal world that they kill each other . Better you protect peace agendas,-
"It’s Israel actually, with US support",-
So witch side are u ? Many palestinian identified with Isis. Murder bumbing terrorism are you with that?,-
"No Palestinians identify with ISIS. The US is funding Syrian rebels, including Al nusra and Al qaeda and ISIS - to fight bashar Al assad",-
Now you support Bassar that kill his own peaple with chimical weppan that is your peace model,-
"Wars are a terrible thing, why was it urgent to enter like animals to murder, rape and kidnap babies, women and children. What kind of religion is this? What is all this about? Maybe Islam will understand that jihad is suffering for everyone Religions can be so cruel",-
This is not a war. This is a pure genocide. It has nothing to do with religion. It’s what happens when you put innocent people into an open air prison For 100 years. Now you know. Most of us could see Oct 7 coming a mile away 🤷🏽‍♂️,-
Maybe you are evil and stupid like the Hamas. Israel is a small land that given to the jewish by low. The arabs lands bigger thousands of times and they still kill and be killed on irran mission . Stupid misrable peaple that could have hidh quality of life and choose to invest all in terror,-
Everything I said above is correct.,-
"IDF have the ability to wipe out Gaza for its inhabitants, but still try as much as possible to preserve human life even if it endangers the soldiers and despite that Hamas takes advantage of it and assimilates among civilians as a human shield",-
"Nonsense. They dropped 65,000 tonnes of explosive (3 Hiroshima bombs) and haven’t put a dent in Hamas. You can verify what I say it true but searching google. US intel Confirms 80% of tunnels are untouched. All those bombs were not for Hamas 😉",-
But accurate. Not like Hamas your friends that shuting hundreds of kg on population. Do you understand the diferent? They are hiding in tunnels that billeds from food and education buddjet,-
Proof that the bombs were not meant for the tunnels: https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-28/ty-article/report-80-percent-of-gaza-strips-tunnel-network-still-intact/0000018d-4fab-d35c-a39f-effbcb0a00 It’s more like 90% but the media likes to skew it. Those bombs were meant for civilians 😉,-
"Haaretz is a radical newslatter It just shows that Israelis know how to criticize themselves when Hamas fires rockets at civilians, it seems very natural that something in Gaza criticizes shooting at residents. They will praise and commend the action. Despicable killers",-
Lol interesting 'source',-
"Here’s the real animals, and the reason Hamas is justified: https://youtu.be/MQ1TAOibLss?si=eR8NiER-bbu0UgWA (Notice their smiles)",-
"These are extreme cases that, if they happened, happened by extremist people who do not reflect the Jewish spirit or the orders of the army. Unlike Hamas, which called on its soldiers to murder and rape in an organized and systematic way, and also distributed drugs to its soldiers so that they could overcome their cruelty towards innocents. It's unbelievable how much you value concepts when the truth is laid before your eyes. Israel still give medical care to palestinian. I didnt hear that plastinian taking care of israelis. Did you?",-
Oh so not it’s few cases. You do realize that entire battalions confessed and they wiped out 400 towns and villages. Bud someone you want us to condemn Hamas.,-
"It is very simple Israel condemns all violence and uses force only to protect its citizens. In the case of Gaza, the elimination of Hamas will only benefit the people of Gaza. But when they fight from hospitals and schools they are glorifying death and harming their own citizens. They dont give a dame on children life they using them . Pure evil",-
"That would be believable if there wasn’t so much footage proving otherwise. Israel is targeting hospitals, schools and 1000+ heritage sites and mosques. 😉",-
And who do you attac if A terrorist shoots missiles on your children from hospital.. do you realise how many weppen found on thos sites?,-
"Israel can’t provide proof that there are in 1% of the cases. So yeah, nobody is buying that story.",-
"She is qnd now After South Africa's lawsuit at the International Court of Justice, she is officially obligated and that is what she will do, and maybe brainwashed people like you will understand who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. I don't know what you see on the news, they probably don't show you the weapons warehouses, the textbooks, the lack of training for 10-year-old children for terrorism. How bad and stupid their parents are.",-
Lke isaid before Hamas use thos places . He is the Hatred and bloodthirsty doesnt They don't feel sorry for their family either. What a poor view of life,-
"Tell me, why is it necessary to create socket puppet accounts to ask these questions? 😉",-
"Israel has been arresting children without cause, abusing them, harassing farmers, occupying land that isn’t their and causing terror for years. Why not condemn Israel as the terrorists they are? There are numerous videos of Israeli men parading around with the underwear of Palestinian women, beating civilians and acting uncivilized. What about the hundreds of children prisoners Israel had before October 7? I in no way support Hamas but Israel is just as bad, maybe worse! The entitled and superiority complexes are absolutely disgusting.",-
"Evil exists in people, the issue is that Israel as a policy condemns any act of violence and if someone behaves in an inappropriate manner he is tried and imprisoned.",-
"Israel’s policy is complete lies. They have been terrorizing people for years, but due to guilt from the holocaust or other issues society doesn’t call them terrorists. “Israel holds over 1,200 detainees without charge. That’s the most in 3 decades, a rights group says.” https://apnews.com/article/israel-detention-jails-palestinians-west-bank-793a3b2a1ce8439d08756da8c63e5435#:~:text=That's%20the%20most%20in%203%20decades%2C%20a%20rights%20group%20says,-FILE%20%2D%20Israeli%20police&text=JERUSALEM%20(AP)%20—%20Israel%20is,human%20rights%20group%20said%20Tuesday.",-
It's a shame that you are so ignorant. Israel took care of Satan Sinwar and saved his life like dozens of enemies. Israel is a light to the Gentiles in everything related to human value and dignity. The problem is that this neighborhood protested with bloodthirsty savages in the name of Islam,-
"Hahaha, It’s a shame people like you even exist in the world. Israel consists of a multitude of terrorists.",-
"If what you say is even true, protesting is not a crime. And they were protesting on land that doesn’t belong to Israel. You make zero sense.",-
"To murder, kidnap and rape, to take captive babies and old people is a protest? What monsters raised you?? Islam preaches the murder of Jews and Christians and the stupid crowd implements",-
"But it’s Israel’s militant army doing all those things. Israel has killed aid workers, doctors, children. Are you completely blind? Actually, it’s obvious you are brainwashed. Israel killed 11 children or more yesterday. https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/04/362095/at-least-11-children-killed-in-new-israeli-attack-on-gaza-refugee-camp https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/4/16/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-vows-response-to-iran",-
"If you really want the truth. Israel is currently in a war against the cruelest of its enemies (more than the Nazis) Israel is doing its best so that innocent people are not harmed. Like using highly accurate bombs and yet mistakes happen. Israel investigates and condemns harm to the innocent. As for Hamas, they kidnapped, burned, decapitated children, raped, and still hold captive 133 children and old men, their stated goal being to destroy Israel. You have to be really unwise if you don't understand which side evil is on",-
You also state “he.” Many of Israel’s hostages are women & children - not HE.,-
The intention was that each such case is treated individually. Only now is a Nohva terrorist hospitalized in an Israeli hospital. You are not able to understand this morality because Shiite Muslim morality has turned you into a bloodthirsty animal,-
I’m not Muslim. This isn’t about religion. Sorry you’re involved is a crazy Jewish cult. Poor thing.,-
"It IS Religion although they'll pretend it's not. I've yet to see Muslims in general protesting as they have now over Syria etc. When there's attacks and murders on non Muslims in France and over the guy who drew their prophet, how come they don't protest then all over the world? Only when asked, then they come up with excuses. In my country as well, I've noticed that when they 'protest' it always turns Violent yet when others protest it hardly ever is. Why is this so? Why should we be afraid to say what we see about the religion of Peace 🕊️",-
Hamas made a big mistake and the orchestrators of october 11 are being eliminated almost daily. The world including gazans will have leadership that protects them and feeds them. Not living like billionaires while gazans suffer.,-
Bullshit. The IDF isn’t even targeting Hamas.,-
You are wrong,-
Mariam is real as is her family.,-
"Your life matters You matter You ppl matter more than us Because u r more human nd compassnate and kind and forgiving than all of uss, Best of ppl . Dont deserve a bit of whats happening",-
"Stay strong, stay safe, take care of yourself and your family.",-
Bring all the kidnaped home and everything will calm down,-
Why they are in prisons? Maybe they try to kill innocent citizens . Like every day . Only month before IDF thwarting hundreds of terrorist attacks and it contiues becouse they are wild stupid peuple and we all must fight them . Sorry that you heart from that try to choose the right side of humanity,-
Did you know that israel give medical care to palestians did you know that devil Sinwar trated and operated on israel hospital by israeli doctors . That becouse Israel morality advocates life . Not like the stupid Jihad that bring only suffer to the world,-
There it is! She's not the one who kidnapped them So Mariam what ARE your views on October 7th? Be brave to be honest for Allah expects you to.,-
Sinwar make so.many peaple misrabale . Ialmost shur that he is the embodiment of Satan,-
"You should think again how much Israel and the Jews have contributed to your health and well-being, whereever you are the amount of aid they send in every catastrophe (earthquakes, famine, agriculture..) but you are brainwashed and probably unable to examine things and verify then you are another soldier in the propaganda against Jews",-
"Many Israelis cry for their loved ones more than you. They did not attack, they put billions iof dollares nto Gaza so that you would be well. But the filthy leaders brought ruin to all",-
"30.000, please stop using that number, its more like 200.000. It was 30.000 the first month of the war. Has no one died since?",-
I see the Internet still works.,-
"“Beckham's company, DB Ventures Ltd, alleges in the lawsuit F45 ""duped"" him into signing on with F45 Training, a company in which Wahlberg has a 36% interest. M.W. also serves as the company's chief brand officer.” They also didn’t pay him the 10 million as promised.",-
They didn’t pay him 10 million and now he’s suing for 10 million seems pretty reasonable to me,-
"Yeah, but the association is important too. If the fact of the case, for example, show Mark exaggerated his interest and daily involvement, that would have been a bigger inducement for David Beckham to enter into the contract with F 45 bc he trusts the company is led by mostly Marks involvement. Learning that he just had 36% investor power and was only a board member, then David may not have entered into the contract because Mark does not have as much wielding power and wtf are these other guys? There is a pretty big difference there. I don't see where the fraud is yet but let's wait for the facts",-
You can’t make that assessment based on 36% ownership. 36% is a normal ownership percentage of a founder in a series B or C round. It’s actually a big amount of ownership,-
"Yes. Adding context, Elon musk owns 20.5% of Tesla stock.",-
"Elon didn’t found Tesla though, he was just an early investor.",-
"Bezos owns like 10% of Amazon, Zuck is an outlier in that he has voting power over the whole company but yeah 36% is a solid chunk of ownership for a company even the size of F45.",-
Dilution of ownership is normal for highly funded startups. Even most founders will get diluted down to a relatively small position of a huge pie. A handful of startups had different classes of shares that gave founders majority voting rights despite minority amounts of equity. That’s not the norm though.,-
Shit I didn’t know that. So do companies just bring him on to purposely run them into the ground?,-
Musk wants you to think he was a Tesla founder. He even got himself designated as a founder long after the founding. One of the actual founders has talked about it. Musk has been a sham from day one. Sell any stock you have in his companies before it's too late. SELL SELL SELL!,-
"Shhh you can't say that, he basically invented electric cars all by himself! AND he hand builds those space x rockets too! Twitter was basically just handed to him by Jesus to spread the good word.The more you know.",-
Sounds like a case of apparent vs actual authority,-
Exactly my first thought. Wahlberg is the worst kind of trash.,-
Beckham was supposed to get shares quicker but they kept delaying and finally when they gave him the equity the stock price had already tanked so he’s suing for losses incurred due to the delay in giving him his shares. It’s a bit more complicated than Marky Mark refusing to pay him money.,-
"I'm still running the numbers but so far it's looking like it'll add up. At the very least, it'll be close.",-
I’ve seen multiple of these gyms go under. Seems like a shit business model as well as crooked.,-
"Knowing nothing about the case, David Beckham doesn't strike me like a guy that sues just to get some money, the mf it's rich...so they probably did screw him over that bad. Against Mark Whalber? doesn't look good on paper.....",-
"He’s only suing for what he was promised, not more. Just to help drive your point home.",-
Beckham vs the bigot and felon. I’ve got Beckham on this one.,-
I think Mark Whalber is conspiring with Mark Wahlberg on this one. Too close to be a coincidence…,-
Same Becks seems like a decent dude Mark has a checkered history,-
Marky Mark is such a carny,-
Hey hey hey…that’s mean to the carny.,-
"Us carnys have to stick together, it's the carny code.",-
He’s messing up my ass groove!,-
I can't believe this racist pos has a public career,-
"Eh, when he started he had decent handlers due to his brother being in New Kids on the Block. I think alot of the Walberg men were trouble makers when they were younger, Donnie had his own rep too. Before Wikipedia, and social media, I'd venture to say most people didn't know about Mark's physical assault for racist reasons. It's much easier looking back to see those issues were always there, but we just know and understand more as a society now. That said, we should also know that when someone shows you who they are... Believe them",-
He has a long history of racism and beat up an old asian man. Now he is a red piller who preaches to every about civility and morality.,-
"I’m not defending him in any way. But people do change, and need to be allowed to change.",-
"Didn't change, campaigns for trump now",-
"2 incidents almost 40 years ago while a teenager count as ""long history of racism?",-
It is when it’s not Asian.,-
"He had 4 racist incidents. Two against black children and 2 against asians. He was convicted of a felony assault but only served 45 days in jail. He also broke his neighbor's jaw. These incidents happened between the age of 15-21. Apparently he only ""learned"" from his mistakes when he became famous.",-
"That’s what F45 is! There’s one near my house and I had no idea what it was. It’s next to a soda shoppe, which always has a line. Marky’s parking lot is always empty.",-
"“combining high-intensity interval training (HIIT), circuit training, and functional training in order to provide you with the results you’re looking for – all in just under an hour.” I think it’s similar to “Orange Theory”. 45 minute fitness classes with a mix of cardio and strength training",-
"""All this sweat got me drip drip""",-
Which I tell people you should be doing - mix it up if you're able. But I get highly suspicious when any gym or person tries to spin that as their own personal magic end all be all regiment. Everything in moderation kids!,-
"A lot of traffic is pretty early in the morning, my sister in law was a trainer there and went from 5:30-9 and most of the clients were through and done by then",-
There one in a strip mall behind my complex and they open the back door and blast their shitty music any time past 9am,-
"There's one near me. I got the idea it was about fitness but that's it. I actually thought it was named ""F4S"". Their logo is a bit non-specific.",-
"I assumed it was a stealth Trumper fitness bro franchise, so Walhberg being so heavily staked is like a surprise bonus validation.",-
I still think this. It’s blue and red and 45 all over,-
I thought it was an anti drumpf place when it first opened near me. F(uck) 45.,-
"I thought it stood for Fit for Summer (F4S, not F45)",-
It was huge in Australia for a while. I had no idea he was affiliated.,-
F45 was really popular here in Australia when they first came out. Now they're all folding like crazy.,-
"Oh totally, the one down the road for me has been empty for years. They can’t even re-lease the space like it’s cursed.",-
"Yup, there is one right by me that opened for 3 months, was a ghost town, then closed. Oops too bad so sad markey jesus freak waldouche.",-
I thought it was a battery store or something,-
"There’s one that’s near me. They put the sign up, but then I guess just gave up, the place is empty and still looks unfinished. Been like that for months now. I finally saw a F45 commercial on YouTube and that’s when I learned it’s supposed to be a gym.",-
I go to my local F45 in London and absolutely love it! I go 6/7 days. Really enjoy it,-
Fuck yeah beckham v wahlberg 2024 let the memes begin,-
I think Wahlberg is a total fraud and racist too.,-
Funny the racist bigot who beats up elderly minorities is shilling for Jesus gets us,-
The least the guy could do is ask how your mother is.,-
"Good, she’s tired from fucking my father.",-
"Don't forget the cliche tequila brand just like 95% of overrated celebs. Attach a name, fill it with sweets and additives and voila!",-
He and his brother have like this awkward bbq branding thing too,-
And Wahlburgers,-
"His brother and McCarthy are a WHOLE other level of batshit, her especially.",-
"Pretty on brand, actually.",-
"No, the commercial was not for Jesus gets us (he gets us). It was for an app. An app that I guess helps you track your praying. But like all apps (especially apps that pay celebs to plug them) it's really about the money.",-
The app is Mark reading prayers to you.,-
"That doesn't surprise me. He probably owns 40% like here. Get that dollar, Mark. Thanks for the info.",-
"LMAO, thank you",-
This is just More fuel for my “Mark Wahlberg is terrible” argument.,-
And a convicted felon.,-
The whole Waaaaburgh clan are fucks,-
Wahlberd is scumbag I hope he loses,-
Mark should go pray about it Hallow: the #1 prayer app. $69.99 per year if you subscribe now!,-
"Are you for real?!? OMG, you are! Charging people for a prayer app? LOL, just like Jesus wanted",-
Mark Wahlberg should have stopped 9/11,-
Never Forget (this comment),-
lets see him bench press his way out of this one what a choad,-
"Where I used to work out, you're ""Wahlbergin' it"" if you only work your Biceps.",-
Is that a jingle all the way reference?,-
“Let’s just say if everyone on that plane was on F45 Fitness it wouldn’t have gone down the way it did” - Mark Wahlberg probably,-
Mark’s pull-ups on that tv show should show you how much working out is a lie for him,-
I loved the “Other Guys” that’s about as far as my mark wahlberg appreciation goes.,-
He's good in Pain and Gain too. He plays a guy who is dumb but thinks he's smart. I find Wahlberg is good at this.,-
"Loved Pain and Gain, I see Mark as nothing else. Other than The Happening, ""What? No"" 🤣",-
"""If you deserve it, the universe will serve it."" The character is well written, with all the dumb self improvement he obsesses on. And he does a good job acting in it. And I'm not saying he can only do dumb roles, but he does do them well. Tony Shalhoub kills it in that movie, of course. He's great at maximizing character roles.",-
He’s a Peacock … ya gotta let him fly!,-
Ted. And transformers. He’s had a few other fun things but nothing so notable I can really remember.,-
"Without knowing the details, I can tell you what a useless scum Mark Wahlberg is, not to mention not talented! Beckham on the other hand… what an American! Brought a whole soccer team for us!",-
"Good! Mark Wahlberg is sketchy, supercilious, and smug. I hope he loses.",-
marky mark is crook.. his movies are dog poop,-
"And Beckham isn't the only person Wahlberger has apparently screwed over. Also from the article: David's not alone. Terrell Owens filed the same type of suit against F45 way back in 2017, claiming the company stiffed him to the tune of $700,000",-
"Mark Wahlberg needs to go sit with Roseanne, Kid Rock, Tim Allen, and all the other “has been” grifters that blame politics and religion for their down fall. In all actuality…they just suck!",-
"... and literally didn't need to tell anyone their stance. Makes me think these people were so in their bubble, think anyone who spends time with them, they were honestly shocked when they got backlash. All of those you named also love to tell us how hard they worked to get where they were. Nah, dig deeper and in alot of ways, they were just lucky - but in their minds/egos no one can ever replace them. Also they love cosplaying ""poor simple folk"" while raking in the money. Shockingly who you publicly claim to support politically has consequences when one political party seems hellbent on taking people's rights away.",-
I love how the Beckhams are assimilating.,-
"Former F45 head office employee here. The franchise was revolutionary when it was launched and they had heads of sports stars (namely footy players) buy franchises and promote it. It was associated with the ultra pretty and ultra fit even though they pitched it for every fitness level... which honestly given the size of the classes and roving trainers , it really didn't suit the entry level gym goer. The owners are two Aussie's who started the whole thing..and they had an Aussie team when they began. Head office.... what a toxic environment that was. They then began going global and branched out to other countries - inc UK and USA - that's where Wahlberg came in. I reckon at that stage the hype and gloss had started to wear off in Aus. Oversaturation of the market, wayyy too many F45 studios in close proximity which resulted in price wars and petty issues. The membership price point each week was high as well.. no surprise that franchise owners decided to start selling them off.",-
Walldouche is a christian zealot.,-
Take every penny from him Becks. The guys an absolute jerkoff .,-
Marks hair is so clearly dyed in that pic,-
"Wait Wahlberg owns that company, lmao, They're scattered all over my city",-
"That’s called his quote. That means even if he does a bad job, they still gotta pay him ten mil.",-
Lots of people are making claims with no context,-
Victoria's birthday bash bill just came I guess.,-
Idk how people even like Wahlberg to begin with. He’s a terrible actor and person on so many levels,-
Wahlberg also has a history of racism and beat the shit out of an Asian man.,-
Isn’t it David’s company’s responsibility to do their due diligence before getting involved? There must be contracts and stuff involved right?,-
Thus is what I was thinking,-
TIL that Mark Wahlberg owns F45🤯,-
"Just when I think Mark Wahlberg couldn't be a bigger piece of shit, he surprises me yet again.",-
I don’t really understand how this article made you think any person could be a piece of shit. I just want to know the rest of the story.,-
Funny how everyone forgets his racist antics,-
"I mean, people can change 🤷🏻‍♂️",-
That’s why you gotta stay prayed up,-
"Mark I beat a man because he was Asian Wahlberg , what a douche.",-
I honestly think Mark Wahlberg is a douche bag. Always have. Muscle hamster.,-
Now we know why is he going to starr in a Mel Gibson movie,-
"Never liked Mark Wahlberg, this is just another reason.",-
Much wants more!,-
"Nothing personal, it’s just business ~ some Mafia guy somewhere, probably.💸",-
"Now this would make a good ""rap battle""/ ""cage match""/ ""otta retire"" and under Rome rules to the death-match. Make way more than 10mill on a weekend.",-
Maybe Wahlberg can just beat him up?,-
I don’t think Becks fits the racial profile for that …,-
"Well Wahlberg is a religious nut who pretends otherwise and hangs with #LyinDonnieDoucheBag when he gets a chance, so why are we surprised?",-
Judge should propose he pay him in wahlburgers,-
"So if Marky Mark only owns 36%, is the article really only calling it his company to get clicks? Unless no one else has stocks higher than 36%. Also, pretty sure Marky Mark could total kick David Beckham’s ass.",-
Could someone give me a tldr of this whole thing? Since it's the first time I've ever heard of this,-
"I skimmed it, and it appears to be that David agreed to endorse the fitness company (due to having a large social media following) and was supposed to be paid some millions for that contribution. They stiffed him, as well as a pro football player a few years back. Basically, Marky Marky tried to do business and needs to stop.",-
"Mark whalers, who is known to be a douche bag liar is being a douchbag liar. Shocked pikachu face.",-
Couldn't be happening to a nicer guy,-
Now he’s going to have to wake up at 1:30 instead of 2am.,-
I would sue Mark Wahlberg for 10 million too if I could. Feel like there’s more than a few people who have the right to sue Mark Wahlberg.,-
Mark beat up a Vietnamese man,-
"Mark Wahlberg and the Rock are essentially the same person. Absolute trash who pretend to be paragons of humanity. Also, Mark Wahlberg can’t do a pull-up.",-
Most athletes who do steroids can’t do pull ups,-
I do f45 It’s expensive and you work to your absolute limit But it’s the only gym/regime that has delivered physique altering results. I’m too sore to move around at least 3 days a week so- be warned,-
You sound like a shill. A regular gym routine will also give you 'physique altering results' if you know what you're doing.,-
Markie was cooler when he cosplays a black rapper.,-
F45 ? Is this to take advantage of the fitness brand established by our late President Trump?,-
I doubt it as it started as an Australian company,-
A second album has crashed the servers,-
You are so unhinged for this but LMAO,-
me n who rn,-
I full on slapped my husbands face in bed. I was aiming for his shoulder but things are unhinged.,-
"I’ve been choking myself trying not to laugh at some of the memes while my partner sleeps. I’m unemployed right now, so my job is to let him sleep while I scroll 😂",-
Me and my Swiftie friends screaming in excitement via text at the same time,-
i remember when this happened; it’s so crazy that it’s a meme now,-
I'm losing my fucking mind over here. Thank god I don't live on the East Coast! Ahhhhh!!!,-
As a corporate east coast swiftie…. Rip me lol,-
"I don’t know how I’m gonna do tomorrow morning, sis. 😩",-
If anyone even looks at me at work…..,-
"Thank god I work from home, that’s all I have to say lmao",-
NON EAST COASTERS REPRESENT (crying in central time),-
"east coast swiftie here, took off 2 days of work for this because i knew blondie was gonna ruin my sleep schedule and my life after midnights. 🫡",-
its for the 4am taylor vibes insomnia girlies,-
I’m dying over here 😂,-
"it’s like she saw the 1989tv surprise double album theories and thought “oh shit that’s a good idea actually, let me do that”",-
"I mean, she kinda did it already with Midnights and the 3am version",-
isn't the 3am version just the deluxe version tho this is an entirely a different situation tho,-
Why is it different? Because its a separate listing entirely with a different cover and stuff? Sorry im slow,-
"Because the 3am tracks only had 7 songs, it was clearly a deluxe edition that she just decided to release the same night as the regular album. This is 15 new songs, more than an albums worth. It’s a double album. Edit: and Taylor herself stated this. This is an anthology, a double album. The 3am tracks were just deluxe tracks for Midnights.",-
"God, I'll never forget where I was when that happened.",-
I was on the toilet,-
I can’t believe we finally got it right. 😂😂😂,-
Shes like im going to let them clown so hard that everyone will think they are nuts And then do exactly that,-
I think she absolutely did this because we wanted her to!,-
"Now let's be honest. The writing was on the walls She must have thought ""let's make this one easy, they never get it right""",-
even a broken clock is right twice a day,-
"I love her, she's ruining my life",-
Guys. I’m a mom. I’m so tired. Idk if I can do a whole nother album tonight. 😭,-
We won’t judge you if you listen tomorrow. I think that’s what I’m going to have to do,-
Thank you. I needed that reassurance. I can’t fully appreciate while I’m in this state. Haha,-
The album isn’t going anywhere. Get some sleep and enjoy it fully in the morning 🤗,-
Am I the only one who’s so happy this did not get leaked anywhere??? 😭😭😭😭😭,-
right like that would’ve been so upsetting if the surprise got ruined,-
"Guess it wasn’t on any physical copies so pretty much impossible to get leaked unless an employee from Spotify or Apple Music leaked. If either of those companies leaked, she probably wouldn’t work with them again",-
I think she did it on purpose because cds and that kind of stuff is bound to leak but we don’t know what the cds and vinyls look like.,-
This second part is a totally different vibe and I love love love it.,-
It seems like TTPD is divided into an A and B side from how the tracks are divided. Two district vibes.,-
It’s like chaotic Folklore and it is everything.,-
I was hoping for a midnights/folklore hybrid… got it!!,-
Yeah it’s so much better!!!,-
Right? Saved all the best songs for the secret half,-
I'm literally finishing the first album still bruh,-
"Same, I’m excited but I should get through the standard first. I wasn’t able to wake up at 5am.",-
"30 songs in one album. Is this a record or something? The work ethic this woman has is freaking crazy. I'm a 21 year old MAN going crazy over here. Not a swiftie, but respect!",-
31 because 13 because she insane,-
TTPD 16 songs TTPD: The Anthology 15 (new) songs 1+6+1+5 = 13 🤯,-
"For her, yes! While it's not the longest album she's ever put out (her re-recording of Red beats it by eight minutes) it is the most tracks she's put into one album!",-
31 songs beats Red TV by 1 song,-
"I only got into Taylor recently but WOW do Swifties eat good. My favorite band is Nine Inch Nails and we haven't had a full album since 2013, and I didn't like it 😭 since then just a couple EP's and a super short album",-
"The Anthology tracks are so far exactly what I wanted. Less Midnights, so much more Folklore/Evermore.",-
For real? I enjoyed this more than Midnights already and folkmore is my life. But I'll I've heard so far was imgonnagetyouback which I enjoyed but didn't get that vibe...guess I gotta dig back in and forget sleep exist 😂,-
SHE DID IT AGAIN!!! SHE SAID FUCK ALL OF YOU WHO THOUGHT YOU'D GET SOME SLEEP TONIGHT!!!!!,-
"She is completely unhinged and an absolute powerhouse. How she manages to find a legendary new move each time is fucking astonishing. I’m not even the biggest Taylor Swift fan (call me a folklore evermore girly who dabbles in her other bangers), I’m loving this album so far. She deserves her spot in history, anyone scathing or trying to take it away from her is as delusional as she is in the Matty Healy songs.",-
"LOL ""As delusional as she is in the Matty Healy songs""",-
"oh my god, she's insane (affectionate)",-
"shes was probably thinking all day fuck the leakers, im a mastermind",-
I’m gleefully laughing at the leakers on her behalf,-
God I love being a Taylor Swift fan - this woman puts out so much content I just end up feeling like this,-
I always joke that this is why anti swifties hate us lol cause she keeps us FED and they’re jealous,-
West Coast girlies she did this for us I’m so HAPPY,-
i feel like a stuffed turkey,-
She just rhymed fuckin Aristotle and Grand Theft Auto,-
the way we got taylor namedropping gta before gta 6-,-
Guys I’m actually losing my mind 😐,-
Is anyone even processing the lyrics??? I have so much adrenaline right now I can’t listen properly lmaoo,-
All I could talk about on TikTok was all the two’s 😭 I knew it was going to be a double drop at 2am,-
Any place got the lyrics up yet? My ADHD ass needs subtitles,-
Fuck me.,-
Up Florida.,-
"I'm having flashbacks to Midnights release day: A bit underwhelming listen of the initial album and then boom, new tracks. Liked the 4am tracks more, we'll see about these.",-
My husband trying to fall asleep as I actually screamed. She is insane for this,-
I fully slapped mine in the face. I was trying to tap his shoulder but all's fair in love and poetry.,-
Taylor it’s past our bedtimes,-
Millennial swiftie here. We are just so lucky we have grown up along WITH her. Time is flying but we are all growing up and maturing together. First crushes. First breakups. Moving away from home. Missing parents. Bullies. Serious relationships. Happy. sad. Anxious. Mad. We’ve all been through it together. Album is everything I didn’t know I needed. Haven’t been this excited and seen in an album since like Speak Now at 17yo!! This one was for us.,-
Glad the ✌️ was more than the Fortnight CD. Would have been an overly elaborate hint otherwise,-
Is this woman not the best thing that ever happened to us?!,-
I KNEW IT! FROM THE PEACE (2) SIGN IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT I KNEW IT,-
Down Bad fuck it if I can’t have sleep,-
Is everyone ok mental health check in are we still alive any casualties? Can someone go see if matty healy is still with us?,-
We don't need to check on him let him be wherever he is 🙏,-
My boyfriend is so supportive of my crazy rn. Really went “HOLY SHIT SHES INSANE” and he’s like “😃😃😃”,-
We weren’t clowning for once!!!!🤍🤍🤍🤍,-
I WAS HEREEEEEEEEEE,-
As a newer Swiftie and night shift worker I'm having a great time.,-
"REST IN PEACE ME, RIP ME, I DIED DEAD.",-
It's the Dessner Anthology! She reserved almost all Aaron tracks for this one. How I love hearing the drums and guitars on So High School and The Bolter! Quintessential Tay I must say. The Anthology could actually pass as a woodvale album!,-
'Oh my god she's insane',-
A FULL B SIDE BASICALLY!? WTF. Does this count as TS12 or is still part of TS11 but it becomes her longest album ever?,-
Definitely TS11 still!,-
DEAR GOD. 31 SONGS. CRYING OVER HERE.,-
WE STAYED FOR THIS AND WE WERE RIGHT IM DEAD,-
"A good day to be in New Zealand, enjoying a nice 6pm listen before I go out",-
RIP anyone who bought all four physical versions 😅,-
Absolutely flabbergasted. Can’t believe I’ve been midnightst again,-
Anyone else loving the anthology more than the original album? Lol,-
On first listen I like the vibe of the tracks with Aaron Dessner way better than the Jack Antonoff ones.,-
