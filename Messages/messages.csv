"He looks like such a friendly dude, it’s hard to believe this is the same dude who made the most psychotic faces in No Way Home, The Lighthouse, etc. Dude has incredible range.",-
"In those movies, Willem was on a sabbatical.",-
Yup he was being Da Foe.,-
Honey,-
Actors who play the worst villians are usually the chillest people irl.,-
"Apparently Louise Fletcher, who specialized in evil characters (Nurse Ratched in Cookoos Nest, Kai Winn on DS9 to name some of the more famous ones) was one of the nicest people in Hollywood.",-
Didn’t she win an Oscar for playing Nurse Ratched?,-
"She was also harassed semi often on the street for how well she did the roles. I heard stories of people being awful, and unfortunately you absolutely see people treating actors like they are the role they played. It must’ve been scary for her, and it’s lame it’s gotten worse w social media. It’s a damn shame someone can perform so well only to be threatened by people who consumed the media!",-
Can’t wait for Keanu to play Hitler.,-
Okay now I’m just picturing Neo in a duster with a Hitler stache,-
He's Willem DaFriend.,-
i think you have to be nice and personable to go off the rails like that...real sycos practice acting calm and normal!,-
You must be an expert on sycos.,-
ALL I WANTED WAS A PEPSI. JUST ONE PEPSI. AND SHE WOULDNT GIVE IT TO ME. JUST A PEPSI. IM NOT CRAZY.,-
YOU’RE THE ONE THAT’S CRAZY,-
total sickos,-
"And incredible dick, if I hear correctly. Also for featuring in films.",-
"An incredible dick literally, not figuratively.",-
“Confusingly large” if I recall the quote from the director correctly.,-
"He has the face of the skinny stoner smoker dude in HS with a hot GF as you sat there wondering how this scrawny, poorly dressed loser could pull such a hot chick. It was the dick. We always knew. We just didn't want to admit we knew.",-
I'm always surprised you guys talk about his penis without having seen it. You can. It's a Google search away. Innallnits dancing glory.,-
"Man i got war flashback from antichrist, clit getting cut by scissors and cock bleeding scenes in particular.",-
I heard they had to use a dick double on Antichrist because it's so massive it was disturbing the film crew. Willem hangs serious dong.,-
"Just watch any of his interviews, Willem is the perfect grandpa",-
Willem Dafriend if you ask me,-
Was the picture taken by J.J. Abrams?,-
Abrams using an iPhone. Does this happen with Android phones too? Genuine question because I hate how this happens every time there's lights in the dark.,-
"It happens when your lenses are (even slightly) dirty from fingerprints or else, you can check it out yourself at night by cleaning it with a shirt/towel and see the difference it makes! That's why I always clean my lenses with what I can before taking a picture with my S21(android)",-
"No, Willem Dafoe just descended from his UFO to take pictures with this guy. You were wondering if there are aliens walking amongst us? Here's the evidence. Edit: Can someone show this proof to Joe Rogan btw?",-
Willem DaUFOe,-
"Not on my Android Pixel. As someone else mentioned it can happen to some degree if your lens is like, super dirty, but A) the phone warns you about the lens and B) Frankly even when I have the warning I don't get this bad of glare at all. Just my experience mind you",-
It happens with any device Abrams uses. It's like a superpower.,-
Believe it or not they actually shine a flashlight at the lens in all those lens flare shots. Edit: missing a etter,-
Nah just the guy taking the pictures has astigmatism,-
"“You know, I’m something of an Abrams myself.”",-
"Saw the image and popped into the comments to make this joke. I'm 32 minutes too late as always, Reddit.",-
I saw that Fringe episode...,-
He is now Willem Dafriend,-
"Shouldn’t it be Willem Daquaintence? I mean, friend is kind of overestimating the relationship if you just take two pictures…😳",-
Not with that Willem Dattitude.,-
Ah yes vintage meme,-
Here take my upvote and get lost,-
Take Dafoe-kin upvote,-
"He met Willem, da vrai.",-
I can't upvote this more than once.,-
"You know, I'm something of a pedestrian myself...",-
,-
I adore how the expression of you both makes It kind of looks like William Dafoe met you...,-
lol i mean he did,-
r/technicallythetruth,-
"Yes, it seems William Dafoe is more eager to take the picture than OP.",-
"“Dude, I'm literally the guy from that meme!” “Okay, dude, whatever, just let's get this done with.”",-
"“Funny thing about Willem Dafoe, his name kinda sounds like a frog talking to a parrot.”",-
Willem…..,-
Da Foooooe!,-
Willem,-
Da Foooooe,-
WILLEM!,-
DA FOOOOOE!,-
r/UnexpectedHIMYM,-
100% expected.,-
I hope you had something nice to say about his lobster,-
"I’ve seen it , your fond of me lobster..",-
HARK TRITON HARK,-
"THOMAS, YER A DOG! A FILTHY DOG! A DOOOOOG!",-
I dunno why but the second picture with his eyes closed made me smile so big,-
My favorite part is unironically the guy in the background eating out of a whole pizza box as he walks.,-
He should be the next Joker,-
"Honestly, I would pay good money to see him play Joker. A Joker at his end of life who got one last prank to pull. Make it happen WB, you fucking cowards.",-
Or just that scene on the rooftop where he's telling a joke to batman.,-
I hate you for putting this idea in my head. Now I know it's one of my wishes where I'll never see it happen.,-
Dafoe: I’m something of a comedian myself,-
"Well, Green Goblin, was basically Spidermans Joker",-
"He could play almost any Batman villain to perfection, even a few of the ones with boobs. The only one out of the question really, I think, is Bane. How about one we don't see mentioned a lot in dream casting: Clayface. You bet your ass Dafoe could do a mean Clayface. Granted, if there's ever a live action Clayface it's almost certainly going to be Andy Serkis for reasons (which, fine), but the point remains.",-
"In Joker 3, he will be the true joker and calls Phoenix joker a phoney.",-
William dafoe needed a body double because his dick was too big Besidesthat congrats,-
Willem DeHog,-
👌 I was only checking the comments to make sure that piece of trivia gets mentioned in any William Dafoe post,-
"Most men have to deal with baseless accusations of having a tiny dick, Defoe gets a personal army making sure everyone knows he’s got a huge dick.",-
"I think the specific word choice is important here, because it wasn’t because it was “too big”, it was “confusingly large”. His dick is so big it induced confusion in a room full of people. Other humans weren’t sure what to do in the presence of this thing.",-
Didnt he lose that in The antichrist?,-
A favorite actor ever,-
Certainly one of the actors ever,-
Often considered among the actors of all time.,-
People say he’s unattractive when compared to other generic Hollywood actors but you can still tell he’s one handsome motherfucker when compared next to an average human being,-
This is where my brain lands when I hear that name. That or flying around fighting spiderman,-
Loved him in Boondock Saints but the first thing to come to mind when I see him or his name is his confusingly large penis,-
He looks innocent and nice while also looking like an evil conman.,-
You're on the sidewalk?!? I'm something of a pedestrian myself.,-
Are you sort of a scientist yourself too?,-
"I can just hear, “Spider-Man”",-
Ha ha ha ha ha evil deranged voice,-
The confident smile of the carrier of 8.5 inches,-
He's hunting spiderman,-
"DaFoe is just amazing. Great actor, seems like a decent human being, which, honestly is the bare minimum we can hope for on terms of celebrities/rich. I'm saying that cause I don't really know that much about him, he seems nice. I have no clue if there're darker things about him that I'm not aware of.",-
He genuinely seems happy to have that picture taken. Willem DaAwesome.,-
